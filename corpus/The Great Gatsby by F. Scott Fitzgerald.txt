i in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that i have been turning over in my mind ever since
whenever you feel like criticizing anyone he told me just remember that all the people in this world have not had the advantages that you have had
he did not say any more but we have always been unusually communicative in a reserved way and i understood that he meant a great deal more than that
in consequence i am inclined to reserve all judgements a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores
the abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person and so it came about that in college i was unjustly accused of being a politician because i was privy to the secret griefs of wild unknown men
most of the confidences were unsought frequently i have feigned sleep preoccupation or a hostile levity when i realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions
reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope
i am still a little afraid of missing something if i forget that as my father snobbishly suggested and i snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth
and after boasting this way of my tolerance i come to the admission that it has a limit
conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point i do not care what it is founded on
when i came back from the east last autumn i felt that i wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever i wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart
only gatsby the man who gives his name to this book was exempt from my reaction gatsby who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn
if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures then there was something gorgeous about him some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away
this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the creative temperament it was an extraordinary gift for hope a romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find again
no gatsby turned out all right at the end it is what preyed on gatsby what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short winded elations of men
my family have been prominent well to do people in this middle western city for three generations
the carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that we are descended from the dukes of buccleuch but the actual founder of my line was my grandfathers brother who came here in fifty one sent a substitute to the civil war and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today
i never saw this great uncle but i am supposed to look like him with special reference to the rather hard boiled painting that hangs in fathers office
i graduated from new haven in 1915 just a quarter of a century after my father and a little later i participated in that delayed teutonic migration known as the great war
i enjoyed the counter raid so thoroughly that i came back restless
instead of being the warm centre of the world the middle west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe so i decided to go east and learn the bond business
everybody i knew was in the bond business so i supposed it could support one more single man
all my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me and finally said why ye es with very grave hesitant faces
father agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays i came east permanently i thought in the spring of twenty two
the practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and i had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea
he found the house a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month but at the last minute the firm ordered him to washington and i went out to the country alone
i had a dog at least i had him for a few days until he ran away and an old dodge and a finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove
it was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man more recently arrived than i stopped me on the road
how do you get to west egg village
he asked helplessly
i told him
and as i walked on i was lonely no longer
i was a guide a pathfinder an original settler
he had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood
and so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees just as things grow in fast movies i had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer
there was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath giving air
i bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint promising to unfold the shining secrets that only midas and morgan and maecenas knew
and i had the high intention of reading many other books besides
i was rather literary in college one year i wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the yale news and now i was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists the well rounded man
this is not just an epigram life is much more successfully looked at from a single window after all
it was a matter of chance that i should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in north america
it was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of new york and where there are among other natural curiosities two unusual formations of land
twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the western hemisphere the great wet barnyard of long island sound
they are not perfect ovals like the egg in the columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact end but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead
to the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size
i lived at west egg the well the less fashionable of the two though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them
my house was at the very tip of the egg only fifty yards from the sound and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season
tel de ville in normandy with a tower on one side spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden
it was gatsbys mansion
or rather as i did not know mr
gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name
my own house was an eyesore but it was a small eyesore and it had been overlooked so i had a view of the water a partial view of my neighbours lawn and the consoling proximity of millionaires all for eighty dollars a month
across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable east egg glittered along the water and the history of the summer really begins on the evening i drove over there to have dinner with the tom buchanans
daisy was my second cousin once removed and i had known tom in college
and just after the war i spent two days with them in chicago
her husband among various physical accomplishments had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new haven a national figure in a way one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax
his family were enormously wealthy even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach but now hed left chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away for instance hed brought down a string of polo ponies from lake forest
it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that
why they came east i do not know
they had spent a year in france for no particular reason and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together
this was a permanent move said daisy over the telephone but i did not believe it i had no sight into daisys heart but i felt that tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game
and so it happened that on a warm windy evening i drove over to east egg to see two old friends whom i scarcely knew at all
their house was even more elaborate than i expected a cheerful red and white georgian colonial mansion overlooking the bay
the lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run
the front was broken by a line of french windows glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon and tom buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch
he had changed since his new haven years
now he was a sturdy straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner
two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward
not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat
it was a body capable of enormous leverage a cruel body
his speaking voice a gruff husky tenor added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed
there was a touch of paternal contempt in it even toward people he liked and there were men at new haven who had hated his guts
now do not think my opinion on these matters is final he seemed to say just because i am stronger and more of a man than you are
we were in the same senior society and while we were never intimate i always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh defiant wistfulness of his own
we talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch
i have got a nice place here he said his eyes flashing about restlessly
turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista including in its sweep a sunken italian garden a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore
it belonged to demaine the oil man
he turned me around again politely and abruptly
well go inside
we walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy coloured space fragilely bound into the house by french windows at either end
the windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house
a breeze blew through the room blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling and then rippled over the wine coloured rug making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea
the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon
they were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house
i must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall
then there was a boom as tom buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor
the younger of the two was a stranger to me
she was extended full length at her end of the divan completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall
if she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it indeed i was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in
the other girl daisy made an attempt to rise she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression then she laughed an absurd charming little laugh and i laughed too and came forward into the room
i am p paralysed with happiness
she laughed again as if she said something very witty and held my hand for a moment looking up into my face promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see
that was a way she had
she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was baker
i have heard it said that daisys murmur was only to make people lean toward her an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming
at any rate miss bakers lips fluttered she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright
again a sort of apology arose to my lips
almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me
i looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low thrilling voice
it was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again
her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget a singing compulsion a whispered listen a promise that she had done gay exciting things just a while since and that there were gay exciting things hovering in the next hour
i told her how i had stopped off in chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me
do they miss me
she cried ecstatically
the whole town is desolate
all the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and theres a persistent wail all night along the north shore
how gorgeous
lets go back tom
tomorrow
then she added irrelevantly you ought to see the baby
i would like to
shes asleep
shes three years old
have not you ever seen her
never
well you ought to see her
shes tom buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder
what you doing nick
i am a bond man
who with
i told him
never heard of them he remarked decisively
this annoyed me
you will i answered shortly
you will if you stay in the east
oh ill stay in the east do not you worry he said glancing at daisy and then back at me as if he were alert for something more
i would be a god damned fool to live anywhere else
at this point miss baker said absolutely
with such suddenness that i started it was the first word she had uttered since i came into the room
evidently it surprised her as much as it did me for she yawned and with a series of rapid deft movements stood up into the room
i am stiff she complained i have been lying on that sofa for as long as i can remember
do not look at me daisy retorted i have been trying to get you to new york all afternoon
no thanks said miss baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry
i am absolutely in training
her host looked at her incredulously
you are
he took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass
how you ever get anything done is beyond me
i looked at miss baker wondering what it was she got done
i enjoyed looking at her
she was a slender small breasted girl with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet
her grey sun strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan charming discontented face
it occurred to me now that i had seen her or a picture of her somewhere before
you live in west egg she remarked contemptuously
i know somebody there
i do not know a single you must know gatsby
gatsby
demanded daisy
what gatsby
before i could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine tom buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square
slenderly languidly their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy coloured porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind
why candles
objected daisy frowning
she snapped them out with her fingers
in two weeks itll be the longest day in the year
she looked at us all radiantly
do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it
i always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it
we ought to plan something yawned miss baker sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed
all right said daisy
whatll we plan
she turned to me helplessly what do people plan
before i could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger
look
she complained i hurt it
we all looked the knuckle was black and blue
you did it tom she said accusingly
i know you did not mean to but you did do it
hulking objected tom crossly even in kidding
hulking insisted daisy
sometimes she and miss baker talked at once unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire
they were here and they accepted tom and me making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained
they knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away
it was sharply different from the west where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself
you make me feel uncivilized daisy i confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret
ca not you talk about crops or something
i meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way
civilizations going to pieces broke out tom violently
i have gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things
have you read the rise of the coloured empires by this man goddard
why no i answered rather surprised by his tone
well it is a fine book and everybody ought to read it
the idea is if we do not look out the white race will be will be utterly submerged
it is all scientific stuff it is been proved
toms getting very profound said daisy with an expression of unthoughtful sadness
he reads deep books with long words in them
what was that word we well these books are all scientific insisted tom glancing at her impatiently
this fellow has worked out the whole thing
it is up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things
we have got to beat them down whispered daisy winking ferociously toward the fervent sun
you ought to live in california began miss baker but tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair
this idea is that we are nordics
i am and you are and you are and after an infinitesimal hesitation he included daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again
and we have produced all the things that go to make civilization oh science and art and all that
do you see
there was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency more acute than of old was not enough to him any more
when almost immediately the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me
ill tell you a family secret she whispered enthusiastically
it is about the butlers nose
do you want to hear about the butlers nose
that is why i came over tonight
well he was not always a butler he used to be the silver polisher for some people in new york that had a silver service for two hundred people
he had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose things went from bad to worse suggested miss baker
yes
things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position
for a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as i listened then the glow faded each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk
the butler came back and murmured something close to toms ear whereupon tom frowned pushed back his chair and without a word went inside
as if his absence quickened something within her daisy leaned forward again her voice glowing and singing
i love to see you at my table nick
you remind me of a of a rose an absolute rose
does not he
she turned to miss baker for confirmation an absolute rose
this was untrue
i am not even faintly like a rose
she was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless thrilling words
then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house
miss baker and i exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning
i was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said sh
in a warning voice
a subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and miss baker leaned forward unashamed trying to hear
the murmur trembled on the verge of coherence sank down mounted excitedly and then ceased altogether
this mr
gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour i began
do not talk
i want to hear what happens
is something happening
i inquired innocently
you mean to say you do not know
said miss baker honestly surprised
i thought everybody knew
i do not
why she said hesitantly
toms got some woman in new york
got some woman
i repeated blankly
miss baker nodded
she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time
do not you think
almost before i had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and tom and daisy were back at the table
it could not be helped
cried daisy with tense gaiety
she sat down glanced searchingly at miss baker and then at me and continued i looked outdoors for a minute and it is very romantic outdoors
theres a bird on the lawn that i think must be a nightingale come over on the cunard or white star line
hes singing away her voice sang it is romantic is not it tom
very romantic he said and then miserably to me if it is light enough after dinner i want to take you down to the stables
the telephone rang inside startlingly and as daisy shook her head decisively at tom the subject of the stables in fact all subjects vanished into air
among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table i remember the candles being lit again pointlessly and i was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone and yet to avoid all eyes
i could not guess what daisy and tom were thinking but i doubt if even miss baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guests shrill metallic urgency out of mind
to a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police
the horses needless to say were not mentioned again
tom and miss baker with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf i followed daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front
in its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee
daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk
i saw that turbulent emotions possessed her so i asked what i thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl
we do not know each other very well nick she said suddenly
even if we are cousins
you did not come to my wedding
i was not back from the war
that is true
she hesitated
well i have had a very bad time nick and i am pretty cynical about everything
evidently she had reason to be
i waited but she did not say any more and after a moment i returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter
i suppose she talks and eats and everything
oh yes
she looked at me absently
listen nick let me tell you what i said when she was born
would you like to hear
very much
itll show you how i have gotten to feel about things
well she was less than an hour old and tom was god knows where
i woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl
she told me it was a girl and so i turned my head away and wept
i am glad it is a girl
and i hope shell be a fool that is the best thing a girl can be in this world a beautiful little fool
you see i think everythings terrible anyhow she went on in a convinced way
everybody thinks so the most advanced people
and i know
i have been everywhere and seen everything and done everything
her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way rather like toms and she laughed with thrilling scorn
sophisticated god i am sophisticated
the instant her voice broke off ceasing to compel my attention my belief i felt the basic insincerity of what she had said
it made me uneasy as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me
i waited and sure enough in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and tom belonged
inside the crimson room bloomed with light
tom and miss baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the saturday evening post the words murmurous and uninflected running together in a soothing tune
the lamplight bright on his boots and dull on the autumn leaf yellow of her hair glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms
when we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand
to be continued she said tossing the magazine on the table in our very next issue
her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee and she stood up
ten oclock she remarked apparently finding the time on the ceiling
time for this good girl to go to bed
jordans going to play in the tournament tomorrow explained daisy over at westchester
oh you are jordan baker
i knew now why her face was familiar its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at asheville and hot springs and palm beach
i had heard some story of her too a critical unpleasant story but what it was i had forgotten long ago
good night she said softly
wake me at eight wo not you
if youll get up
i will
good night mr
carraway
see you anon
of course you will confirmed daisy
in fact i think ill arrange a marriage
come over often nick and ill sort of oh fling you together
you know lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat and all that sort of thing good night called miss baker from the stairs
i have not heard a word
shes a nice girl said tom after a moment
they ought not to let her run around the country this way
who ought not to
inquired daisy coldly
her family
her family is one aunt about a thousand years old
besides nicks going to look after her are not you nick
shes going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer
i think the home influence will be very good for her
daisy and tom looked at each other for a moment in silence
is she from new york
i asked quickly
from louisville
our white girlhood was passed together there
our beautiful white did you give nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda
demanded tom suddenly
did i
she looked at me
i ca not seem to remember but i think we talked about the nordic race
yes i am sure we did
it sort of crept up on us and first thing you know do not believe everything you hear nick he advised me
i said lightly that i had heard nothing at all and a few minutes later i got up to go home
they came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light
as i started my motor daisy peremptorily called wait
i forgot to ask you something and it is important
we heard you were engaged to a girl out west
that is right corroborated tom kindly
we heard that you were engaged
it is a libel
i am too poor
but we heard it insisted daisy surprising me by opening up again in a flower like way
we heard it from three people so it must be true
of course i knew what they were referring to but i was not even vaguely engaged
the fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons i had come east
you ca not stop going with an old friend on account of rumours and on the other hand i had no intention of being rumoured into marriage
their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich nevertheless i was confused and a little disgusted as i drove away
it seemed to me that the thing for daisy to do was to rush out of the house child in arms but apparently there were no such intentions in her head
as for tom the fact that he had some woman in new york was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book
something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart
already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages where new red petrol pumps sat out in pools of light and when i reached my estate at west egg i ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard
the wind had blown off leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life
the silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it i saw that i was not alone fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbours mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars
something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was mr
gatsby himself come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens
i decided to call to him
miss baker had mentioned him at dinner and that would do for an introduction
but i did not call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way and far as i was from him i could have sworn he was trembling
involuntarily i glanced seaward and distinguished nothing except a single green light minute and far away that might have been the end of a dock
when i looked once more for gatsby he had vanished and i was alone again in the unquiet darkness
ii about halfway between west egg and new york the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land
this is a valley of ashes a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally with a transcendent effort of ash grey men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air
occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest and immediately the ash grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight
but above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it you perceive after a moment the eyes of doctor t
j
eckleburg
the eyes of doctor t
j
eckleburg are blue and gigantic their retinas are one yard high
they look out of no face but instead from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose
evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of queens and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away
but his eyes dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain brood on over the solemn dumping ground
the valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour
there is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that i first met tom buchanans mistress
the fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known
s with her and leaving her at a table sauntered about chatting with whomsoever he knew
though i was curious to see her i had no desire to meet her but i did
i went up to new york with tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ash heaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car
we are getting off he insisted
i want you to meet my girl
i think hed tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence
the supercilious assumption was that on sunday afternoon i had nothing better to do
i followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under doctor eckleburgs persistent stare
the only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land a sort of compact main street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing
one of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all night restaurant approached by a trail of ashes the third was a garage repairs
george b
wilson
cars bought and sold
and i followed tom inside
the interior was unprosperous and bare the only car visible was the dust covered wreck of a ford which crouched in a dim corner
it had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office wiping his hands on a piece of waste
he was a blond spiritless man anaemic and faintly handsome
when he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes
hello wilson old man said tom slapping him jovially on the shoulder
hows business
i ca not complain answered wilson unconvincingly
when are you going to sell me that car
next week i have got my man working on it now
works pretty slow do not he
no he does not said tom coldly
and if you feel that way about it maybe id better sell it somewhere else after all
i do not mean that explained wilson quickly
i just meant his voice faded off and tom glanced impatiently around the garage
then i heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door
she was in the middle thirties and faintly stout but she carried her flesh sensuously as some women can
pe de chine contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering
she smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with tom looking him flush in the eye
then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft coarse voice get some chairs why do not you so somebody can sit down
oh sure agreed wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls
a white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity except his wife who moved close to tom
i want to see you said tom intently
get on the next train
all right
ill meet you by the newsstand on the lower level
she nodded and moved away from him just as george wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door
we waited for her down the road and out of sight
it was a few days before the fourth of july and a grey scrawny italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track
terrible place is not it said tom exchanging a frown with doctor eckleburg
awful
it does her good to get away
does not her husband object
wilson
he thinks she goes to see her sister in new york
hes so dumb he does not know hes alive
so tom buchanan and his girl and i went up together to new york or not quite together for mrs
wilson sat discreetly in another car
tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those east eggers who might be on the train
she had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as tom helped her to the platform in new york
at the newsstand she bought a copy of town tattle and a moving picture magazine and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume
upstairs in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one lavender coloured with grey upholstery and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine
but immediately she turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass
i want to get one of those dogs she said earnestly
i want to get one for the apartment
theyre nice to have a dog
we backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to john d
rockefeller
in a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed
what kind are they
asked mrs
wilson eagerly as he came to the taxi window
all kinds
what kind do you want lady
i would like to get one of those police dogs i do not suppose you got that kind
the man peered doubtfully into the basket plunged in his hand and drew one up wriggling by the back of the neck
that is no police dog said tom
no it is not exactly a police dog said the man with disappointment in his voice
it is more of an airedale
he passed his hand over the brown washrag of a back
look at that coat
some coat
that is a dog thatll never bother you with catching cold
i think it is cute said mrs
wilson enthusiastically
how much is it
that dog
he looked at it admiringly
that dog will cost you ten dollars
the airedale undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly white changed hands and settled down into mrs
wilsons lap where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture
is it a boy or a girl
she asked delicately
that dog
that dogs a boy
it is a bitch said tom decisively
heres your money
go and buy ten more dogs with it
we drove over to fifth avenue warm and soft almost pastoral on the summer sunday afternoon
i would not have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner
hold on i said i have to leave you here
no you do not interposed tom quickly
myrtlell be hurt if you do not come up to the apartment
wo not you myrtle
come on she urged
ill telephone my sister catherine
shes said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know
well i would like to but we went on cutting back again over the park toward the west hundreds
at 158th street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment houses
throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood mrs
wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went haughtily in
i am going to have the mckees come up she announced as we rose in the elevator
and of course i got to call up my sister too
the apartment was on the top floor a small living room a small dining room a small bedroom and a bath
the living room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of versailles
the only picture was an over enlarged photograph apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock
looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room
several old copies of town tattle lay on the table together with a copy of simon called peter and some of the small scandal magazines of broadway
mrs
wilson was first concerned with the dog
a reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large hard dog biscuits one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon
meanwhile tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door
i have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it although until after eight oclock the apartment was full of cheerful sun
sitting on toms lap mrs
wilson called up several people on the telephone then there were no cigarettes and i went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner
when i came back they had both disappeared so i sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of simon called peter either it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things because it did not make any sense to me
after the first drink mrs
reappeared company commenced to arrive at the apartment door
the sister catherine was a slender worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky white
her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face
when she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms
she came in with such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that i wondered if she lived here
but when i asked her she laughed immoderately repeated my question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel
mr
mckee was a pale feminine man from the flat below
he had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room
he informed me that he was in the artistic game and i gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of mrs
wilsons mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall
his wife was shrill languid handsome and horrible
she told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty seven times since they had been married
mrs
wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream coloured chiffon which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room
with the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change
the intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur
her laughter her gestures her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy creaking pivot through the smoky air
my dear she told her sister in a high mincing shout most of these fellas will cheat you every time
all they think of is money
i had a woman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the bill you would of thought she had my appendicitis out
what was the name of the woman
asked mrs
mckee
mrs
eberhardt
she goes around looking at peoples feet in their own homes
i like your dress remarked mrs
mckee i think it is adorable
mrs
wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain
it is just a crazy old thing she said
i just slip it on sometimes when i do not care what i look like
but it looks wonderful on you if you know what i mean pursued mrs
mckee
if chester could only get you in that pose i think he could make something of it
we all looked in silence at mrs
wilson who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile
mr
mckee regarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face
i should change the light he said after a moment
i would like to bring out the modelling of the features
and i would try to get hold of all the back hair
i would not think of changing the light cried mrs
mckee
i think it is her husband said sh
and we all looked at the subject again whereupon tom buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet
you mckees have something to drink he said
get some more ice and mineral water myrtle before everybody goes to sleep
i told that boy about the ice
myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders
these people
you have to keep after them all the time
she looked at me and laughed pointlessly
then she flounced over to the dog kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there
i have done some nice things out on long island asserted mr
mckee
tom looked at him blankly
two of them we have framed downstairs
two what
demanded tom
two studies
one of them i call montauk point the gulls and the other i call montauk point the sea
the sister catherine sat down beside me on the couch
do you live down on long island too
she inquired
i live at west egg
really
i was down there at a party about a month ago
at a man named gatsbys
do you know him
i live next door to him
well they say hes a nephew or a cousin of kaiser wilhelms
that is where all his money comes from
really
she nodded
i am scared of him
i would hate to have him get anything on me
this absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by mrs
mckees pointing suddenly at catherine chester i think you could do something with her she broke out but mr
mckee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention to tom
i would like to do more work on long island if i could get the entry
all i ask is that they should give me a start
ask myrtle said tom breaking into a short shout of laughter as mrs
wilson entered with a tray
shell give you a letter of introduction wo not you myrtle
do what
she asked startled
youll give mckee a letter of introduction to your husband so he can do some studies of him
george b
wilson at the gasoline pump or something like that
catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear neither of them can stand the person theyre married to
ca not they
ca not stand them
she looked at myrtle and then at tom
what i say is why go on living with them if they ca not stand them
if i was them i would get a divorce and get married to each other right away
does not she like wilson either
the answer to this was unexpected
it came from myrtle who had overheard the question and it was violent and obscene
you see cried catherine triumphantly
she lowered her voice again
it is really his wife that is keeping them apart
shes a catholic and they do not believe in divorce
daisy was not a catholic and i was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie
when they do get married continued catherine theyre going west to live for a while until it blows over
itd be more discreet to go to europe
oh do you like europe
she exclaimed surprisingly
i just got back from monte carlo
really
just last year
i went over there with another girl
stay long
no we just went to monte carlo and back
we went by way of marseilles
we had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms
we had an awful time getting back i can tell you
god how i hated that town
the late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the mediterranean then the shrill voice of mrs
mckee called me back into the room
i almost made a mistake too she declared vigorously
i almost married a little kike whod been after me for years
i knew he was below me
lucille that mans way below you
but if i had not met chester hed of got me sure
yes but listen said myrtle wilson nodding her head up and down at least you did not marry him
i know i did not
well i married him said myrtle ambiguously
and that is the difference between your case and mine
why did you myrtle
demanded catherine
nobody forced you to
myrtle considered
i married him because i thought he was a gentleman she said finally
i thought he knew something about breeding but he was not fit to lick my shoe
you were crazy about him for a while said catherine
crazy about him
cried myrtle incredulously
who said i was crazy about him
i never was any more crazy about him than i was about that man there
she pointed suddenly at me and everyone looked at me accusingly
i tried to show by my expression that i expected no affection
the only crazy i was was when i married him
i knew right away i made a mistake
oh is that your suit
i said
this is the first i ever heard about it
but i gave it to him and then i lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon
she really ought to get away from him resumed catherine to me
theyve been living over that garage for eleven years
and toms the first sweetie she ever had
the bottle of whisky a second one was now in constant demand by all present excepting catherine who felt just as good on nothing at all
tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches which were a complete supper in themselves
i wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time i tried to go i became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back as if with ropes into my chair
yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets and i saw him too looking up and wondering
i was within and without simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life
myrtle pulled her chair close to mine and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with tom
it was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train
i was going up to new york to see my sister and spend the night
he had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes and i could not keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at me i had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head
when we came into the station he was next to me and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm and so i told him i would have to call a policeman but he knew i lied
i was so excited that when i got into a taxi with him i did not hardly know i was not getting into a subway train
you ca not live forever you ca not live forever
she turned to mrs
mckee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter
my dear she cried i am going to give you this dress as soon as i am through with it
i have got to get another one tomorrow
i am going to make a list of all the things i have got to get
a massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring and a wreath with a black silk bow for mothers grave thatll last all summer
i got to write down a list so i wo not forget all the things i got to do
it was nine oclock almost immediately afterward i looked at my watch and found it was ten
mr
mckee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap like a photograph of a man of action
taking out my handkerchief i wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon
the little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke and from time to time groaning faintly
people disappeared reappeared made plans to go somewhere and then lost each other searched for each other found each other a few feet away
some time toward midnight tom buchanan and mrs
wilson stood face to face discussing in impassioned voices whether mrs
wilson had any right to mention daisys name
daisy
daisy
daisy
shouted mrs
wilson
ill say it whenever i want to
daisy
dai making a short deft movement tom buchanan broke her nose with his open hand
then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor and womens voices scolding and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain
mr
mckee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door
when he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the scene his wife and catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid and the despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread a copy of town tattle over the tapestry scenes of versailles
then mr
mckee turned and continued on out the door
taking my hat from the chandelier i followed
come to lunch some day he suggested as we groaned down in the elevator
where
anywhere
keep your hands off the lever snapped the elevator boy
i beg your pardon said mr
mckee with dignity i did not know i was touching it
all right i agreed ill be glad to
i was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets clad in his underwear with a great portfolio in his hands
then i was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the pennsylvania station staring at the morning tribune and waiting for the four oclock train
iii there was music from my neighbours house through the summer nights
in his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars
at high tide in the afternoon i watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats slit the waters of the sound drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam
on weekends his rolls royce became an omnibus bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains
and on mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing brushes and hammers and garden shears repairing the ravages of the night before
every friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in new york every monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves
there was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butlers thumb
at least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a christmas tree of gatsbys enormous garden
on buffet tables garnished with glistening hors doeuvre spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold
in the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another
by seven oclock the orchestra has arrived no thin five piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums
the last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs the cars from new york are parked five deep in the drive and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours and hair bobbed in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of castile
the bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each others names
the lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher
laughter is easier minute by minute spilled with prodigality tipped out at a cheerful word
the groups change more swiftly swell with new arrivals dissolve and form in the same breath already there are wanderers confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable become for a sharp joyous moment the centre of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea change of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light
suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal seizes a cocktail out of the air dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform
a momentary hush the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is gilda grays understudy from the follies
the party has begun
i believe that on the first night i went to gatsbys house i was one of the few guests who had actually been invited
people were not invited they went there
they got into automobiles which bore them out to long island and somehow they ended up at gatsbys door
once there they were introduced by somebody who knew gatsby and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park
sometimes they came and went without having met gatsby at all came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission
i had been actually invited
a chauffeur in a uniform of robins egg blue crossed my lawn early that saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer the honour would be entirely gatsbys it said if i would attend his little party that night
he had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it signed jay gatsby in a majestic hand
dressed up in white flannels i went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people i did not know though here and there was a face i had noticed on the commuting train
i was immediately struck by the number of young englishmen dotted about all well dressed all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous americans
i was sure that they were selling something bonds or insurance or automobiles
they were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key
as soon as i arrived i made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom i asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that i slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone
i was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when jordan baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden
welcome or not i found it necessary to attach myself to someone before i should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby
hello
i roared advancing toward her
my voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden
i thought you might be here she responded absently as i came up
i remembered you lived next door to she held my hand impersonally as a promise that shed take care of me in a minute and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps
hello
they cried together
sorry you did not win
that was for the golf tournament
she had lost in the finals the week before
you do not know who we are said one of the girls in yellow but we met you here about a month ago
you have dyed your hair since then remarked jordan and i started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon produced like the supper no doubt out of a caterers basket
with jordans slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden
a tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men each one introduced to us as mr
mumble
do you come to these parties often
inquired jordan of the girl beside her
the last one was the one i met you at answered the girl in an alert confident voice
she turned to her companion was not it for you lucille
it was for lucille too
i like to come lucille said
i never care what i do so i always have a good time
when i was here last i tore my gown on a chair and he asked me my name and address inside of a week i got a package from croiriers with a new evening gown in it
did you keep it
asked jordan
sure i did
i was going to wear it tonight but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered
it was gas blue with lavender beads
two hundred and sixty five dollars
theres something funny about a fellow thatll do a thing like that said the other girl eagerly
he does not want any trouble with anybody
who does not
i inquired
gatsby
somebody told me the two girls and jordan leaned together confidentially
somebody told me they thought he killed a man once
a thrill passed over all of us
the three mr
mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly
i do not think it is so much that argued lucille sceptically it is more that he was a german spy during the war
one of the men nodded in confirmation
i heard that from a man who knew all about him grew up with him in germany he assured us positively
oh no said the first girl it could not be that because he was in the american army during the war
as our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm
you look at him sometimes when he thinks nobodys looking at him
ill bet he killed a man
she narrowed her eyes and shivered
lucille shivered
we all turned and looked around for gatsby
it was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world
the first supper there would be another one after midnight was now being served and jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden
there were three married couples and jordans escort a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree
instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside east egg condescending to west egg and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety
lets get out whispered jordan after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half hour this is much too polite for me
we got up and she explained that we were going to find the host i had never met him she said and it was making me uneasy
the undergraduate nodded in a cynical melancholy way
the bar where we glanced first was crowded but gatsby was not there
she could not find him from the top of the steps and he was not on the veranda
on a chance we tried an important looking door and walked into a high gothic library panelled with carved english oak and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas
a stout middle aged man with enormous owl eyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books
as we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined jordan from head to foot
what do you think
he demanded impetuously
about what
he waved his hand toward the bookshelves
about that
as a matter of fact you need not bother to ascertain
i ascertained
theyre real
the books
he nodded
absolutely real have pages and everything
i thought theyd be a nice durable cardboard
matter of fact theyre absolutely real
pages and here
lemme show you
taking our scepticism for granted he rushed to the bookcases and returned with volume one of the stoddard lectures
see
he cried triumphantly
it is a bona fide piece of printed matter
it fooled me
this fellas a regular belasco
it is a triumph
what thoroughness
what realism
knew when to stop too did not cut the pages
but what do you want
what do you expect
he snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse
who brought you
he demanded
or did you just come
i was brought
most people were brought
jordan looked at him alertly cheerfully without answering
i was brought by a woman named roosevelt he continued
mrs
claud roosevelt
do you know her
i met her somewhere last night
i have been drunk for about a week now and i thought it might sober me up to sit in a library
has it
a little bit i think
i ca not tell yet
i have only been here an hour
did i tell you about the books
theyre real
theyre you told us
we shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors
there was dancing now on the canvas in the garden old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles superior couples holding each other tortuously fashionably and keeping in the corners and a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps
by midnight the hilarity had increased
a celebrated tenor had sung in italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing stunts all over the garden while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky
a pair of stage twins who turned out to be the girls in yellow did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls
the moon had risen higher and floating in the sound was a triangle of silver scales trembling a little to the stiff tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn
i was still with jordan baker
we were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter
i was enjoying myself now
i had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant elemental and profound
at a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled
your face is familiar he said politely
were not you in the first division during the war
why yes
i was in the twenty eighth infantry
i was in the sixteenth until june nineteen eighteen
i knew i would seen you somewhere before
we talked for a moment about some wet grey little villages in france
evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning
want to go with me old sport
just near the shore along the sound
what time
any time that suits you best
it was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when jordan looked around and smiled
having a gay time now
she inquired
much better
i turned again to my new acquaintance
this is an unusual party for me
i have not even seen the host
i live over there i waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance and this man gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation
for a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand
i am gatsby he said suddenly
what
i exclaimed
oh i beg your pardon
i thought you knew old sport
i am afraid i am not a very good host
he smiled understandingly much more than understandingly
it was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it that you may come across four or five times in life
it faced or seemed to face the whole eternal world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour
it understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that at your best you hoped to convey
precisely at that point it vanished and i was looking at an elegant young roughneck a year or two over thirty whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd
some time before he introduced himself id got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care
almost at the moment when mr
gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that chicago was calling him on the wire
he excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn
if you want anything just ask for it old sport he urged me
excuse me
i will rejoin you later
when he was gone i turned immediately to jordan constrained to assure her of my surprise
i had expected that mr
gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years
who is he
i demanded
do you know
hes just a man named gatsby
where is he from i mean
and what does he do
now you are started on the subject she answered with a wan smile
well he told me once he was an oxford man
a dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away
however i do not believe it
why not
i do not know she insisted i just do not think he went there
something in her tone reminded me of the other girls i think he killed a man and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity
i would have accepted without question the information that gatsby sprang from the swamps of louisiana or from the lower east side of new york
that was comprehensible
but young men did not at least in my provincial inexperience i believed they did not drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on long island sound
anyhow he gives large parties said jordan changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete
and i like large parties
theyre so intimate
at small parties there is not any privacy
there was the boom of a bass drum and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden
ladies and gentlemen he cried
at the request of mr
gatsby we are going to play for you mr
vladmir tostoffs latest work which attracted so much attention at carnegie hall last may
if you read the papers you know there was a big sensation
he smiled with jovial condescension and added some sensation
whereupon everybody laughed
vladmir tostoffs jazz history of the world
the nature of mr
tostoffs composition eluded me because just as it began my eyes fell on gatsby standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes
his tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day
i could see nothing sinister about him
i wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased
when the jazz history of the world was over girls were putting their heads on mens shoulders in a puppyish convivial way girls were swooning backward playfully into mens arms even into groups knowing that someone would arrest their falls but no one swooned backward on gatsby and no french bob touched gatsbys shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with gatsbys head for one link
i beg your pardon
gatsbys butler was suddenly standing beside us
miss baker
he inquired
i beg your pardon but mr
gatsby would like to speak to you alone
with me
she exclaimed in surprise
yes madame
she got up slowly raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment and followed the butler toward the house
i noticed that she wore her evening dress all her dresses like sports clothes there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean crisp mornings
i was alone and it was almost two
for some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many windowed room which overhung the terrace
eluding jordans undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls and who implored me to join him i went inside
the large room was full of people
one of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall red haired young lady from a famous chorus engaged in song
she had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sad she was not only singing she was weeping too
whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano
the tears coursed down her cheeks not freely however for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets
a humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep
she had a fight with a man who says hes her husband explained a girl at my elbow
i looked around
most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands
even jordans party the quartet from east egg were rent asunder by dissension
one of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond and hissed you promised
into his ear
the reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men
the hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives
the wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices
whenever he sees i am having a good time he wants to go home
never heard anything so selfish in my life
we are always the first ones to leave
so are we
well we are almost the last tonight said one of the men sheepishly
the orchestra left half an hour ago
in spite of the wives agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility the dispute ended in a short struggle and both wives were lifted kicking into the night
as i waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and jordan baker and gatsby came out together
he was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye
jordans party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands
i have just heard the most amazing thing she whispered
how long were we in there
why about an hour
simply amazing she repeated abstractedly
but i swore i would not tell it and here i am tantalizing you
she yawned gracefully in my face
under the name of mrs
she was hurrying off as she talked her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door
rather ashamed that on my first appearance i had stayed so late i joined the last of gatsbys guests who were clustered around him
i wanted to explain that id hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden
do not mention it he enjoined me eagerly
do not give it another thought old sport
the familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder
and do not forget we are going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine oclock
then the butler behind his shoulder philadelphia wants you on the phone sir
all right in a minute
good night
good night
good night
he smiled and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go as if he had desired it all the time
good night
but as i walked down the steps i saw that the evening was not quite over
fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene
which had left gatsbys drive not two minutes before
the sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs
however as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene
a man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant puzzled way
see
he explained
it went in the ditch
the fact was infinitely astonishing to him and i recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the man it was the late patron of gatsbys library
howd it happen
he shrugged his shoulders
i know nothing whatever about mechanics he said decisively
but how did it happen
did you run into the wall
do not ask me said owl eyes washing his hands of the whole matter
i know very little about driving next to nothing
it happened and that is all i know
well if you are a poor driver you ought not to try driving at night
but i was not even trying he explained indignantly i was not even trying
an awed hush fell upon the bystanders
do you want to commit suicide
you are lucky it was just a wheel
a bad driver and not even trying
you do not understand explained the criminal
i was not driving
theres another man in the car
the shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained ah h h
swung slowly open
the crowd it was now a crowd stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause
then very gradually part by part a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe
blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster
whas matter
he inquired calmly
did we run outa gas
look
half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel he stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky
it came off someone explained
he nodded
at first i din notice wed stopped
a pause
then taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice wonderff tell me where theres a gasline station
at least a dozen men some of them a little better off than he was explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond
back out he suggested after a moment
put her in reverse
but the wheels off
he hesitated
no harm in trying he said
the caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and i turned away and cut across the lawn toward home
i glanced back once
a wafer of a moon was shining over gatsbys house making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden
a sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell
reading over what i have written so far i see i have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me
on the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and until much later they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs
most of the time i worked
in the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as i hurried down the white chasms of lower new york to the probity trust
i knew the other clerks and young bond salesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee
i even had a short affair with a girl who lived in jersey city and worked in the accounting department but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in july i let it blow quietly away
i took dinner usually at the yale club for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day and then i went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour
there were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work
after that if the night was mellow i strolled down madison avenue past the old murray hill hotel and over 33rd street to the pennsylvania station
i began to like new york the racy adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye
i liked to walk up fifth avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes i was going to enter into their lives and no one would ever know or disapprove
sometimes in my mind i followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness
at the enchanted metropolitan twilight i felt a haunting loneliness sometimes and felt it in others poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner young clerks in the dusk wasting the most poignant moments of night and life
again at eight oclock when the dark lanes of the forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs bound for the theatre district i felt a sinking in my heart
forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited and voices sang and there was laughter from unheard jokes and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside
imagining that i too was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement i wished them well
for a while i lost sight of jordan baker and then in midsummer i found her again
at first i was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and everyone knew her name
then it was something more
i was not actually in love but i felt a sort of tender curiosity
the bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something most affectations conceal something eventually even though they do not in the beginning and one day i found what it was
when we were on a house party together up in warwick she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down and then lied about it and suddenly i remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at daisys
at her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round
the thing approached the proportions of a scandal then died away
a caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken
the incident and the name had remained together in my mind
jordan baker instinctively avoided clever shrewd men and now i saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible
she was incurably dishonest
she was not able to endure being at a disadvantage and given this unwillingness i suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body
it made no difference to me
dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply i was casually sorry and then i forgot
it was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car
it started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one mans coat
you are a rotten driver i protested
either you ought to be more careful or you ought not to drive at all
i am careful
no you are not
well other people are she said lightly
what is that got to do with it
theyll keep out of my way she insisted
it takes two to make an accident
suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself
i hope i never will she answered
i hate careless people
that is why i like you
her grey sun strained eyes stared straight ahead but she had deliberately shifted our relations and for a moment i thought i loved her
but i am slow thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires and i knew that first i had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home
id been writing letters once a week and signing them love nick and all i could think of was how when that certain girl played tennis a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip
nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before i was free
everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues and this is mine i am one of the few honest people that i have ever known
iv on sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore the world and its mistress returned to gatsbys house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn
hes a bootlegger said the young ladies moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers
one time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to von hindenburg and second cousin to the devil
reach me a rose honey and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass
once i wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of those who came to gatsbys house that summer
it is an old timetable now disintegrating at its folds and headed this schedule in effect july 5th 1922
but i can still read the grey names and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted gatsbys hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him
from east egg then came the chester beckers and the leeches and a man named bunsen whom i knew at yale and doctor webster civet who was drowned last summer up in maine
and the hornbeams and the willie voltaires and a whole clan named blackbuck who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near
or rather hubert auerbach and mr
and edgar beaver whose hair they say turned cotton white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all
clarence endive was from east egg as i remember
he came only once in white knickerbockers and had a fight with a bum named etty in the garden
from farther out on the island came the cheadles and the o
r
p
schraeders and the stonewall jackson abrams of georgia and the fishguards and the ripley snells
snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary so drunk out on the gravel drive that mrs
ulysses swetts automobile ran over his right hand
the dancies came too and s
b
whitebait who was well over sixty and maurice a
flink and the hammerheads and beluga the tobacco importer and belugas girls
from west egg came the poles and the mulreadys and cecil roebuck and cecil schoen and gulick the state senator and newton orchid who controlled films par excellence and eckhaust and clyde cohen and don s
and arthur mccarty all connected with the movies in one way or another
and the catlips and the bembergs and g
earl muldoon brother to that muldoon who afterward strangled his wife
da fontano the promoter came there and ed legros and james b
ferret and the de jongs and ernest lilly they came to gamble and when ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and associated traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day
a man named klipspringer was there so often that he became known as the boarder i doubt if he had any other home
of theatrical people there were gus waize and horace odonavan and lester myer and george duckweed and francis bull
also from new york were the chromes and the backhyssons and the dennickers and russel betty and the corrigans and the kellehers and the dewars and the scullys and s
w
belcher and the smirkes and the young quinns divorced now and henry l
palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in times square
benny mcclenahan arrived always with four girls
they were never quite the same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before
i have forgotten their names jaqueline i think or else consuela or gloria or judy or june and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great american capitalists whose cousins if pressed they would confess themselves to be
in addition to all these i can remember that faustina obrien came there at least once and the baedeker girls and young brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and mr
e and ardita fitz peters and mr
p
jewett once head of the american legion and miss claudia hip with a man reputed to be her chauffeur and a prince of something whom we called duke and whose name if i ever knew it i have forgotten
all these people came to gatsbys house in the summer
at nine oclock one morning late in july gatsbys gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three noted horn
it was the first time he had called on me though i had gone to two of his parties mounted in his hydroplane and at his urgent invitation made frequent use of his beach
good morning old sport
you are having lunch with me today and i thought wed ride up together
he was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly american that comes i suppose with the absence of lifting work in youth and even more with the formless grace of our nervous sporadic games
this quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness
he was never quite still there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand
he saw me looking with admiration at his car
it is pretty is not it old sport
he jumped off to give me a better view
have not you ever seen it before
id seen it
everybody had seen it
it was a rich cream colour bright with nickel swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper boxes and toolboxes and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns
sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town
i had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found to my disappointment that he had little to say
so my first impression that he was a person of some undefined consequence had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door
and then came that disconcerting ride
we had not reached west egg village before gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel coloured suit
look here old sport he broke out surprisingly what is your opinion of me anyhow
a little overwhelmed i began the generalized evasions which that question deserves
well i am going to tell you something about my life he interrupted
i do not want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear
so he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation in his halls
ill tell you gods truth
his right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by
i am the son of some wealthy people in the middle west all dead now
i was brought up in america but educated at oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years
it is a family tradition
he looked at me sideways and i knew why jordan baker had believed he was lying
he hurried the phrase educated at oxford or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had bothered him before
and with this doubt his whole statement fell to pieces and i wondered if there was not something a little sinister about him after all
what part of the middle west
i inquired casually
san francisco
i see
my family all died and i came into a good deal of money
his voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him
for a moment i suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at him convinced me otherwise
after that i lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of europe paris venice rome collecting jewels chiefly rubies hunting big game painting a little things for myself only and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago
with an effort i managed to restrain my incredulous laughter
the very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned character leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the bois de boulogne
then came the war old sport
it was a great relief and i tried very hard to die but i seemed to bear an enchanted life
i accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began
in the argonne forest i took the remains of my machine gun battalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry could not advance
we stayed there two days and two nights a hundred and thirty men with sixteen lewis guns and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three german divisions among the piles of dead
i was promoted to be a major and every allied government gave me a decoration even montenegro little montenegro down on the adriatic sea
little montenegro
he lifted up the words and nodded at them with his smile
the smile comprehended montenegros troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the montenegrin people
it appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from montenegros warm little heart
my incredulity was submerged in fascination now it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines
he reached in his pocket and a piece of metal slung on a ribbon fell into my palm
that is the one from montenegro
to my astonishment the thing had an authentic look
orderi di danilo ran the circular legend montenegro nicolas rex
turn it
major jay gatsby i read for valour extraordinary
heres another thing i always carry
a souvenir of oxford days
it was taken in trinity quad the man on my left is now the earl of doncaster
it was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires
there was gatsby looking a little not much younger with a cricket bat in his hand
then it was all true
i saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the grand canal i saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease with their crimson lighted depths the gnawings of his broken heart
i am going to make a big request of you today he said pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction so i thought you ought to know something about me
i did not want you to think i was just some nobody
you see i usually find myself among strangers because i drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me
he hesitated
youll hear about it this afternoon
at lunch
no this afternoon
i happened to find out that you are taking miss baker to tea
do you mean you are in love with miss baker
no old sport i am not
but miss baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter
i had not the faintest idea what this matter was but i was more annoyed than interested
i had not asked jordan to tea in order to discuss mr
jay gatsby
i was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment i was sorry id ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn
he would not say another word
his correctness grew on him as we neared the city
we passed port roosevelt where there was a glimpse of red belted oceangoing ships and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen hundreds
then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us and i had a glimpse of mrs
wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by
with fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half astoria only half for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated i heard the familiar jug jug spat
of a motorcycle and a frantic policeman rode alongside
all right old sport called gatsby
we slowed down
taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the mans eyes
right you are agreed the policeman tipping his cap
know you next time mr
gatsby
excuse me
what was that
i inquired
the picture of oxford
i was able to do the commissioner a favour once and he sends me a christmas card every year
over the great bridge with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money
the city seen from the queensboro bridge is always the city seen for the first time in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world
a dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for friends
the friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern europe and i was glad that the sight of gatsbys splendid car was included in their sombre holiday
as we crossed blackwells island a limousine passed us driven by a white chauffeur in which sat three modish negroes two bucks and a girl
i laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry
even gatsby could happen without any particular wonder
roaring noon
in a well fanned forty second street cellar i met gatsby for lunch
blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom talking to another man
mr
carraway this is my friend mr
wolfshiem
a small flat nosed jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril
after a moment i discovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness
so i took one look at him said mr
wolfshiem shaking my hand earnestly and what do you think i did
what
i inquired politely
but evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and covered gatsby with his expressive nose
all right katspaugh do not pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth
he shut it then and there
gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant whereupon mr
wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction
highballs
asked the head waiter
this is a nice restaurant here said mr
wolfshiem looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling
but i like across the street better
yes highballs agreed gatsby and then to mr
wolfshiem it is too hot over there
hot and small yes said mr
wolfshiem but full of memories
what place is that
i asked
the old metropole
the old metropole brooded mr
wolfshiem gloomily
filled with faces dead and gone
filled with friends gone now forever
i ca not forget so long as i live the night they shot rosy rosenthal there
it was six of us at the table and rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening
when it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside
all right says rosy and begins to get up and i pulled him down in his chair
let the bastards come in here if they want you rosy but do not you so help me move outside this room
it was four oclock in the morning then and if wed of raised the blinds wed of seen daylight
did he go
i asked innocently
sure he went
mr
wolfshiems nose flashed at me indignantly
do not let that waiter take away my coffee
then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away
four of them were electrocuted i said remembering
five with becker
his nostrils turned to me in an interested way
i understand you are looking for a business gonnegtion
the juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling
gatsby answered for me oh no he exclaimed this is not the man
no
mr
wolfshiem seemed disappointed
this is just a friend
i told you wed talk about that some other time
i beg your pardon said mr
wolfshiem i had a wrong man
a succulent hash arrived and mr
wolfshiem forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old metropole began to eat with ferocious delicacy
his eyes meanwhile roved very slowly all around the room he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind
i think that except for my presence he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table
look here old sport said gatsby leaning toward me i am afraid i made you a little angry this morning in the car
there was the smile again but this time i held out against it
i do not like mysteries i answered and i do not understand why you wo not come out frankly and tell me what you want
why has it all got to come through miss baker
oh it is nothing underhand he assured me
miss bakers a great sportswoman you know and shed never do anything that was not all right
suddenly he looked at his watch jumped up and hurried from the room leaving me with mr
wolfshiem at the table
he has to telephone said mr
wolfshiem following him with his eyes
fine fellow is not he
handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman
yes
hes an oggsford man
oh
he went to oggsford college in england
you know oggsford college
i have heard of it
it is one of the most famous colleges in the world
have you known gatsby for a long time
i inquired
several years he answered in a gratified way
i made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war
but i knew i had discovered a man of fine breeding after i talked with him an hour
theres the kind of man you would like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister
he paused
i see you are looking at my cuff buttons
i had not been looking at them but i did now
they were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory
finest specimens of human molars he informed me
well
i inspected them
that is a very interesting idea
yeah
he flipped his sleeves up under his coat
yeah gatsbys very careful about women
he would never so much as look at a friends wife
when the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down mr
wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet
i have enjoyed my lunch he said and i am going to run off from you two young men before i outstay my welcome
do not hurry meyer said gatsby without enthusiasm
mr
wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction
you are very polite but i belong to another generation he announced solemnly
you sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your he supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand
as for me i am fifty years old and i wo not impose myself on you any longer
as he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling
i wondered if i had said anything to offend him
he becomes very sentimental sometimes explained gatsby
this is one of his sentimental days
hes quite a character around new york a denizen of broadway
who is he anyhow an actor
no
a dentist
meyer wolfshiem
no hes a gambler
gatsby hesitated then added coolly hes the man who fixed the worlds series back in 1919
fixed the worlds series
i repeated
the idea staggered me
i remembered of course that the worlds series had been fixed in 1919 but if i had thought of it at all i would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened the end of some inevitable chain
it never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people with the single mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe
how did he happen to do that
i asked after a minute
he just saw the opportunity
why is not he in jail
they ca not get him old sport
hes a smart man
i insisted on paying the check
as the waiter brought my change i caught sight of tom buchanan across the crowded room
come along with me for a minute i said i have got to say hello to someone
when he saw us tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction
whereve you been
he demanded eagerly
daisys furious because you have not called up
this is mr
gatsby mr
buchanan
they shook hands briefly and a strained unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over gatsbys face
howve you been anyhow
demanded tom of me
howd you happen to come up this far to eat
i have been having lunch with mr
gatsby
i turned toward mr
gatsby but he was no longer there
i was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns
i was happier on the lawns because i had on shoes from england with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground
i had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut tut tut tut in a disapproving way
the largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to daisy fays house
she was just eighteen two years older than me and by far the most popular of all the young girls in louisville
she dressed in white and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from camp taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night
anyways for an hour
when i came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant i had never seen before
they were so engrossed in each other that she did not see me until i was five feet away
hello jordan she called unexpectedly
please come here
i was flattered that she wanted to speak to me because of all the older girls i admired her most
she asked me if i was going to the red cross to make bandages
i was
well then would i tell them that she could not come that day
the officer looked at daisy while she was speaking in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime and because it seemed romantic to me i have remembered the incident ever since
his name was jay gatsby and i did not lay eyes on him again for over four years even after id met him on long island i did not realize it was the same man
that was nineteen seventeen
by the next year i had a few beaux myself and i began to play in tournaments so i did not see daisy very often
she went with a slightly older crowd when she went with anyone at all
wild rumours were circulating about her how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to new york and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas
she was effectually prevented but she was not on speaking terms with her family for several weeks
after that she did not play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat footed shortsighted young men in town who could not get into the army at all
by the next autumn she was gay again gay as ever
but after the armistice and in february she was presumably engaged to a man from new orleans
in june she married tom buchanan of chicago with more pomp and circumstance than louisville ever knew before
he came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the muhlbach hotel and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars
i was a bridesmaid
i came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the june night in her flowered dress and as drunk as a monkey
she had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other
gratulate me she muttered
never had a drink before but oh how i do enjoy it
what is the matter daisy
i was scared i can tell you id never seen a girl like that before
here dearies
she groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls
take em downstairs and give em back to whoever they belong to
tell em all daisys change her mine
daisys change her mine
she began to cry she cried and cried
i rushed out and found her mothers maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath
she would not let go of the letter
she took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow
but she did not say another word
we gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over
next day at five oclock she married tom buchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months trip to the south seas
i saw them in santa barbara when they came back and i thought id never seen a girl so mad about her husband
if he left the room for a minute shed look around uneasily and say wheres tom gone
and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door
she used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight
it was touching to see them together it made you laugh in a hushed fascinated way
that was in august
a week after i left santa barbara tom ran into a wagon on the ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car
the girl who was with him got into the papers too because her arm was broken she was one of the chambermaids in the santa barbara hotel
the next april daisy had her little girl and they went to france for a year
i saw them one spring in cannes and later in deauville and then they came back to chicago to settle down
daisy was popular in chicago as you know
they moved with a fast crowd all of them young and rich and wild but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation
perhaps because she does not drink
it is a great advantage not to drink among hard drinking people
you can hold your tongue and moreover you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they do not see or care
well about six weeks ago she heard the name gatsby for the first time in years
it was when i asked you do you remember
if you knew gatsby in west egg
after you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up and said what gatsby
and when i described him i was half asleep she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know
it was not until then that i connected this gatsby with the officer in her white car
when jordan baker had finished telling all this we had left the plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through central park
the sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the west fifties and the clear voices of children already gathered like crickets on the grass rose through the hot twilight i am the sheik of araby
your love belongs to me
at night when you are asleep into your tent ill creep it was a strange coincidence i said
but it was not a coincidence at all
why not
gatsby bought that house so that daisy would be just across the bay
then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that june night
he came alive to me delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendour
he wants to know continued jordan if youll invite daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over
the modesty of the demand shook me
he had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could come over some afternoon to a strangers garden
did i have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing
hes afraid hes waited so long
he thought you might be offended
you see hes regular tough underneath it all
something worried me
why did not he ask you to arrange a meeting
he wants her to see his house she explained
and your house is right next door
oh
i think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties some night went on jordan but she never did
then he began asking people casually if they knew her and i was the first one he found
it was that night he sent for me at his dance and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it
i do not want to do anything out of the way
he kept saying
i want to see her right next door
when i said you were a particular friend of toms he started to abandon the whole idea
he does not know very much about tom though he says hes read a chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of daisys name
it was dark now and as we dipped under a little bridge i put my arm around jordans golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner
suddenly i was not thinking of daisy and gatsby any more but of this clean hard limited person who dealt in universal scepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm
a phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement there are only the pursued the pursuing the busy and the tired
and daisy ought to have something in her life murmured jordan to me
does she want to see gatsby
shes not to know about it
gatsby does not want her to know
you are just supposed to invite her to tea
ade of fifty ninth street a block of delicate pale light beamed down into the park
unlike gatsby and tom buchanan i had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so i drew up the girl beside me tightening my arms
her wan scornful mouth smiled and so i drew her up again closer this time to my face
v when i came home to west egg that night i was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire
two oclock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires
turning a corner i saw that it was gatsbys house lit from tower to cellar
at first i thought it was another party a wild rout that had resolved itself into hide and go seek or sardines in the box with all the house thrown open to the game
but there was not a sound
only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness
as my taxi groaned away i saw gatsby walking toward me across his lawn
your place looks like the worlds fair i said
does it
he turned his eyes toward it absently
i have been glancing into some of the rooms
lets go to coney island old sport
in my car
it is too late
well suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool
i have not made use of it all summer
i have got to go to bed
all right
he waited looking at me with suppressed eagerness
i talked with miss baker i said after a moment
i am going to call up daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea
oh that is all right he said carelessly
i do not want to put you to any trouble
what day would suit you
what day would suit you
he corrected me quickly
i do not want to put you to any trouble you see
how about the day after tomorrow
he considered for a moment
then with reluctance i want to get the grass cut he said
we both looked down at the grass there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker well kept expanse of his began
i suspected that he meant my grass
theres another little thing he said uncertainly and hesitated
would you rather put it off for a few days
i asked
oh it is not about that
at least he fumbled with a series of beginnings
why i thought why look here old sport you do not make much money do you
not very much
this seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently
i thought you did not if youll pardon my you see i carry on a little business on the side a sort of side line you understand
and i thought that if you do not make very much you are selling bonds are not you old sport
trying to
well this would interest you
it would not take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money
it happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing
i realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life
but because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered i had no choice except to cut him off there
i have got my hands full i said
i am much obliged but i could not take on any more work
you would not have to do any business with wolfshiem
evidently he thought that i was shying away from the gonnegtion mentioned at lunch but i assured him he was wrong
he waited a moment longer hoping id begin a conversation but i was too absorbed to be responsive so he went unwillingly home
the evening had made me lightheaded and happy i think i walked into a deep sleep as i entered my front door
so i do not know whether or not gatsby went to coney island or for how many hours he glanced into rooms while his house blazed gaudily on
i called up daisy from the office next morning and invited her to come to tea
do not bring tom i warned her
what
do not bring tom
tom
she asked innocently
the day agreed upon was pouring rain
at eleven oclock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawn mower tapped at my front door and said that mr
gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass
this reminded me that i had forgotten to tell my finn to come back so i drove into west egg village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers
the flowers were unnecessary for at two oclock a greenhouse arrived from gatsbys with innumerable receptacles to contain it
an hour later the front door opened nervously and gatsby in a white flannel suit silver shirt and gold coloured tie hurried in
he was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes
is everything all right
he asked immediately
the grass looks fine if that is what you mean
what grass
he inquired blankly
oh the grass in the yard
he looked out the window at it but judging from his expression i do not believe he saw a thing
looks very good he remarked vaguely
one of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four
i think it was the journal
have you got everything you need in the shape of of tea
i took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the finn
together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop
will they do
i asked
of course of course
theyre fine
old sport
the rain cooled about half past three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew
gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of clays economics starting at the finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside
finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home
whys that
nobodys coming to tea
it is too late
he looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere
i ca not wait all day
do not be silly it is just two minutes to four
he sat down miserably as if i had pushed him and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane
we both jumped up and a little harrowed myself i went out into the yard
under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the drive
it stopped
daisys face tipped sideways beneath a three cornered lavender hat looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile
is this absolutely where you live my dearest one
the exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain
i had to follow the sound of it for a moment up and down with my ear alone before any words came through
a damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as i took it to help her from the car
are you in love with me she said low in my ear or why did i have to come alone
that is the secret of castle rackrent
tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour
come back in an hour ferdie
then in a grave murmur his name is ferdie
does the gasoline affect his nose
i do not think so she said innocently
why
we went in
to my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted
well that is funny i exclaimed
what is funny
she turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door
i went out and opened it
gatsby pale as death with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes
with his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the living room
it was not a bit funny
aware of the loud beating of my own heart i pulled the door to against the increasing rain
for half a minute there was not a sound
then from the living room i heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by daisys voice on a clear artificial note i certainly am awfully glad to see you again
a pause it endured horribly
i had nothing to do in the hall so i went into the room
gatsby his hands still in his pockets was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease even of boredom
his head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair
we have met before muttered gatsby
his eyes glanced momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh
luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place
then he sat down rigidly his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand
i am sorry about the clock he said
my own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn
i could not muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head
it is an old clock i told them idiotically
i think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor
we have not met for many years said daisy her voice as matter of fact as it could ever be
five years next november
the automatic quality of gatsbys answer set us all back at least another minute
i had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac finn brought it in on a tray
amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself
gatsby got himself into a shadow and while daisy and i talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes
however as calmness was not an end in itself i made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet
where are you going
demanded gatsby in immediate alarm
ill be back
i have got to speak to you about something before you go
he followed me wildly into the kitchen closed the door and whispered oh god
in a miserable way
what is the matter
this is a terrible mistake he said shaking his head from side to side a terrible terrible mistake
you are just embarrassed that is all and luckily i added daisys embarrassed too
shes embarrassed
he repeated incredulously
just as much as you are
do not talk so loud
you are acting like a little boy i broke out impatiently
not only that but you are rude
daisys sitting in there all alone
he raised his hand to stop my words looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room
i walked out the back way just as gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before and ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain
once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn well shaved by gatsbys gardener abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes
there was nothing to look at from under the tree except gatsbys enormous house so i stared at it like kant at his church steeple for half an hour
a brewer had built it early in the period craze a decade before and there was a story that hed agreed to pay five years taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw
perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to found a family he went into an immediate decline
his children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door
americans while willing even eager to be serfs have always been obstinate about being peasantry
after half an hour the sun shone again and the grocers automobile rounded gatsbys drive with the raw material for his servants dinner i felt sure he would not eat a spoonful
a maid began opening the upper windows of his house appeared momentarily in each and leaning from the large central bay spat meditatively into the garden
it was time i went back
while the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion
but in the new silence i felt that silence had fallen within the house too
i went in after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of pushing over the stove but i do not believe they heard a sound
they were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air and every vestige of embarrassment was gone
daisys face was smeared with tears and when i came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror
but there was a change in gatsby that was simply confounding
he literally glowed without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well being radiated from him and filled the little room
oh hello old sport he said as if he had not seen me for years
i thought for a moment he was going to shake hands
it is stopped raining
has it
when he realized what i was talking about that there were twinkle bells of sunshine in the room he smiled like a weather man like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light and repeated the news to daisy
what do you think of that
it is stopped raining
i am glad jay
her throat full of aching grieving beauty told only of her unexpected joy
i want you and daisy to come over to my house he said id like to show her around
you are sure you want me to come
absolutely old sport
daisy went upstairs to wash her face too late i thought with humiliation of my towels while gatsby and i waited on the lawn
my house looks well does not it
he demanded
see how the whole front of it catches the light
i agreed that it was splendid
yes
his eyes went over it every arched door and square tower
it took me just three years to earn the money that bought it
i thought you inherited your money
i did old sport he said automatically but i lost most of it in the big panic the panic of the war
i think he hardly knew what he was saying for when i asked him what business he was in he answered that is my affair before he realized that it was not an appropriate reply
oh i have been in several things he corrected himself
i was in the drug business and then i was in the oil business
but i am not in either one now
he looked at me with more attention
do you mean you have been thinking over what i proposed the other night
before i could answer daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight
that huge place there
she cried pointing
do you like it
i love it but i do not see how you live there all alone
i keep it always full of interesting people night and day
people who do interesting things
celebrated people
instead of taking the shortcut along the sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern
with enchanting murmurs daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky admired the gardens the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kiss me at the gate
it was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees
and inside as we wandered through marie antoinette music rooms and restoration salons i felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through
as gatsby closed the door of the merton college library i could have sworn i heard the owl eyed man break into ghostly laughter
we went upstairs through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers through dressing rooms and poolrooms and bathrooms with sunken baths intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor
it was mr
klipspringer the boarder
i had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning
finally we came to gatsbys own apartment a bedroom and a bath and an adams study where we sat down and drank a glass of some chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall
he had not once ceased looking at daisy and i think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well loved eyes
sometimes too he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real
once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs
his bedroom was the simplest room of all except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold
daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair whereupon gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh
it is the funniest thing old sport he said hilariously
i ca not when i try to he had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third
after his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence
he had been full of the idea so long dreamed it right through to the end waited with his teeth set so to speak at an inconceivable pitch of intensity
now in the reaction he was running down like an over wound clock
recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing gowns and ties and his shirts piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high
i have got a man in england who buys me clothes
he sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season spring and fall
he took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many coloured disarray
while we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of indian blue
suddenly with a strained sound daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily
theyre such beautiful shirts she sobbed her voice muffled in the thick folds
it makes me sad because i have never seen such such beautiful shirts before
after the house we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowers but outside gatsbys window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the sound
if it was not for the mist we could see your home across the bay said gatsby
you always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock
daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said
possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever
compared to the great distance that had separated him from daisy it had seemed very near to her almost touching her
it had seemed as close as a star to the moon
now it was again a green light on a dock
his count of enchanted objects had diminished by one
i began to walk about the room examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness
a large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me hung on the wall over his desk
whos this
that
that is mr
dan cody old sport
the name sounded faintly familiar
hes dead now
he used to be my best friend years ago
there was a small picture of gatsby also in yachting costume on the bureau gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly taken apparently when he was about eighteen
i adore it exclaimed daisy
the pompadour
you never told me you had a pompadour or a yacht
look at this said gatsby quickly
heres a lot of clippings about you
they stood side by side examining it
i was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang and gatsby took up the receiver
he rang off
come here quick
cried daisy at the window
the rain was still falling but the darkness had parted in the west and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea
look at that she whispered and then after a moment id like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around
i tried to go then but they would not hear of it perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone
i know what well do said gatsby well have klipspringer play the piano
he went out of the room calling ewing
and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed slightly worn young man with shell rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair
he was now decently clothed in a sport shirt open at the neck sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue
did we interrupt your exercise
inquired daisy politely
i was asleep cried mr
klipspringer in a spasm of embarrassment
that is id been asleep
klipspringer plays the piano said gatsby cutting him off
do not you ewing old sport
i do not play well
i do not hardly play at all
i am all out of prac well go downstairs interrupted gatsby
he flipped a switch
the grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light
in the music room gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano
he lit daisys cigarette from a trembling match and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall
when klipspringer had played the love nest he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for gatsby in the gloom
i am all out of practice you see
i told you i could not play
i am all out of prac do not talk so much old sport commanded gatsby
play
in the morning in the evening ai not we got fun outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the sound
all the lights were going on in west egg now the electric trains men carrying were plunging home through the rain from new york
it was the hour of a profound human change and excitement was generating on the air
one things sure and nothings surer the rich get richer and the poor get children
in the meantime in between time as i went over to say goodbye i saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into gatsbys face as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness
almost five years
there must have been moments even that afternoon when daisy tumbled short of his dreams not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion
it had gone beyond her beyond everything
he had thrown himself into it with a creative passion adding to it all the time decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way
no amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart
as i watched him he adjusted himself a little visibly
his hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion
i think that voice held him most with its fluctuating feverish warmth because it could not be over dreamed that voice was a deathless song
they had forgotten me but daisy glanced up and held out her hand gatsby did not know me now at all
i looked once more at them and they looked back at me remotely possessed by intense life
then i went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain leaving them there together
vi about this time an ambitious young reporter from new york arrived one morning at gatsbys door and asked him if he had anything to say
anything to say about what
inquired gatsby politely
why any statement to give out
it transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard gatsbys name around his office in a connection which he either would not reveal or did not fully understand
this was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out to see
it was a random shot and yet the reporters instinct was right
gatsbys notoriety spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities upon his past had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news
contemporary legends such as the underground pipeline to canada attached themselves to him and there was one persistent story that he did not live in a house at all but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the long island shore
just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to james gatz of north dakota is not easy to say
james gatz that was really or at least legally his name
he had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career when he saw dan codys yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on lake superior
it was james gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants but it was already jay gatsby who borrowed a rowboat pulled out to the tuolomee and informed cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour
i suppose hed had the name ready for a long time even then
his parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all
the truth was that jay gatsby of west egg long island sprang from his platonic conception of himself
he was a son of god a phrase which if it means anything means just that and he must be about his fathers business the service of a vast vulgar and meretricious beauty
so he invented just the sort of jay gatsby that a seventeen year old boy would be likely to invent and to this conception he was faithful to the end
for over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of lake superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed
his brown hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce half lazy work of the bracing days
he knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them of young virgins because they were ignorant of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self absorption he took for granted
but his heart was in a constant turbulent riot
the most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night
a universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor
each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace
for a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairys wing
an instinct toward his future glory had led him some months before to the small lutheran college of st
olafs in southern minnesota
he stayed there two weeks dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny to destiny itself and despising the janitors work with which he was to pay his way through
then he drifted back to lake superior and he was still searching for something to do on the day that dan codys yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore
cody was fifty years old then a product of the nevada silver fields of the yukon of every rush for metal since seventy five
the transactions in montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft mindedness and suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money
the none too savoury ramifications by which ella kaye the newspaper woman played madame de maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht were common property of the turgid journalism in 1902
he had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as james gatzs destiny in little girl bay
to young gatz resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world
i suppose he smiled at cody he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled
and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious
a few days later he took him to duluth and bought him a blue coat six pairs of white duck trousers and a yachting cap
and when the tuolomee left for the west indies and the barbary coast gatsby left too
he was employed in a vague personal capacity while he remained with cody he was in turn steward mate skipper secretary and even jailor for dan cody sober knew what lavish doings dan cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in gatsby
the arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the continent
it might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that ella kaye came on board one night in boston and a week later dan cody inhospitably died
i remember the portrait of him up in gatsbys bedroom a grey florid man with a hard empty face the pioneer debauchee who during one phase of american life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon
it was indirectly due to cody that gatsby drank so little
sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone
and it was from cody that he inherited money a legacy of twenty five thousand dollars
he did not get it
he never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to ella kaye
he was left with his singularly appropriate education the vague contour of jay gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man
he told me all this very much later but i have put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents which were not even faintly true
moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion when i had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him
so i take advantage of this short halt while gatsby so to speak caught his breath to clear this set of misconceptions away
it was a halt too in my association with his affairs
for several weeks i did not see him or hear his voice on the phone mostly i was in new york trotting around with jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt but finally i went over to his house one sunday afternoon
i had not been there two minutes when somebody brought tom buchanan in for a drink
i was startled naturally but the really surprising thing was that it had not happened before
they were a party of three on horseback tom and a man named sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously
i am delighted to see you said gatsby standing on his porch
i am delighted that you dropped in
as though they cared
sit right down
have a cigarette or a cigar
he walked around the room quickly ringing bells
ill have something to drink for you in just a minute
he was profoundly affected by the fact that tom was there
but he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for
mr
sloane wanted nothing
a lemonade
no thanks
a little champagne
i am sorry did you have a nice ride
very good roads around here
i suppose the automobiles yeah
moved by an irresistible impulse gatsby turned to tom who had accepted the introduction as a stranger
i believe we have met somewhere before mr
buchanan
oh yes said tom gruffly polite but obviously not remembering
so we did
i remember very well
about two weeks ago
that is right
you were with nick here
i know your wife continued gatsby almost aggressively
that so
tom turned to me
you live near here nick
next door
that so
mr
sloane did not enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair the woman said nothing either until unexpectedly after two highballs she became cordial
well all come over to your next party mr
gatsby she suggested
what do you say
certainly id be delighted to have you
be ver nice said mr
sloane without gratitude
well think ought to be starting home
please do not hurry gatsby urged them
he had control of himself now and he wanted to see more of tom
why do not you why do not you stay for supper
i would not be surprised if some other people dropped in from new york
you come to supper with me said the lady enthusiastically
both of you
this included me
mr
sloane got to his feet
come along he said but to her only
i mean it she insisted
id love to have you
lots of room
gatsby looked at me questioningly
he wanted to go and he did not see that mr
sloane had determined he should not
i am afraid i wo not be able to i said
well you come she urged concentrating on gatsby
mr
sloane murmured something close to her ear
we wo not be late if we start now she insisted aloud
i have not got a horse said gatsby
i used to ride in the army but i have never bought a horse
ill have to follow you in my car
excuse me for just a minute
the rest of us walked out on the porch where sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside
my god i believe the mans coming said tom
does not he know she does not want him
she says she does want him
she has a big dinner party and he wo not know a soul there
he frowned
i wonder where in the devil he met daisy
by god i may be old fashioned in my ideas but women run around too much these days to suit me
they meet all kinds of crazy fish
suddenly mr
sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses
come on said mr
sloane to tom we are late
we have got to go
and then to me tell him we could not wait will you
tom and i shook hands the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive disappearing under the august foliage just as gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door
tom was evidently perturbed at daisys running around alone for on the following saturday night he came with her to gatsbys party
perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness it stands out in my memory from gatsbys other parties that summer
there were the same people or at least the same sort of people the same profusion of champagne the same many coloured many keyed commotion but i felt an unpleasantness in the air a pervading harshness that had not been there before
or perhaps i had merely grown used to it grown to accept west egg as a world complete in itself with its own standards and its own great figures second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so and now i was looking at it again through daisys eyes
it is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment
they arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds daisys voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat
these things excite me so she whispered
if you want to kiss me any time during the evening nick just let me know and ill be glad to arrange it for you
just mention my name
or present a green card
i am giving out green look around suggested gatsby
i am looking around
i am having a marvellous you must see the faces of many people you have heard about
toms arrogant eyes roamed the crowd
we do not go around very much he said in fact i was just thinking i do not know a soul here
perhaps you know that lady
gatsby indicated a gorgeous scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree
tom and daisy stared with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies
shes lovely said daisy
the man bending over her is her director
he took them ceremoniously from group to group mrs
and mr
buchanan after an instants hesitation he added the polo player
oh no objected tom quickly not me
but evidently the sound of it pleased gatsby for tom remained the polo player for the rest of the evening
i have never met so many celebrities daisy exclaimed
i liked that man what was his name
with the sort of blue nose
gatsby identified him adding that he was a small producer
well i liked him anyhow
id a little rather not be the polo player said tom pleasantly id rather look at all these famous people in in oblivion
daisy and gatsby danced
i remember being surprised by his graceful conservative foxtrot i had never seen him dance before
then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while at her request i remained watchfully in the garden
in case theres a fire or a flood she explained or any act of god
tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together
do you mind if i eat with some people over here
he said
a fellows getting off some funny stuff
go ahead answered daisy genially and if you want to take down any addresses heres my little gold pencil
she looked around after a moment and told me the girl was common but pretty and i knew that except for the half hour shed been alone with gatsby she was not having a good time
we were at a particularly tipsy table
that was my fault gatsby had been called to the phone and id enjoyed these same people only two weeks before
but what had amused me then turned septic on the air now
how do you feel miss baedeker
the girl addressed was trying unsuccessfully to slump against my shoulder
at this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes
wha
a massive and lethargic woman who had been urging daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow spoke in miss baedekers defence oh shes all right now
when shes had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that
i tell her she ought to leave it alone
i do leave it alone affirmed the accused hollowly
theres somebody that needs your help doc
shes much obliged i am sure said another friend without gratitude but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool
anything i hate is to get my head stuck in a pool mumbled miss baedeker
they almost drowned me once over in new jersey
then you ought to leave it alone countered doctor civet
speak for yourself
cried miss baedeker violently
your hand shakes
i would not let you operate on me
it was like that
almost the last thing i remember was standing with daisy and watching the moving picture director and his star
they were still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between
it occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity and even while i watched i saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek
i like her said daisy i think shes lovely
but the rest offended her and inarguably because it was not a gesture but an emotion
she was appalled by west egg this unprecedented place that broadway had begotten upon a long island fishing village appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing
she saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand
i sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car
it was dark here in front only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning
sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing room blind above gave way to another shadow an indefinite procession of shadows who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass
who is this gatsby anyhow
demanded tom suddenly
some big bootlegger
whered you hear that
i inquired
i did not hear it
i imagined it
a lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers you know
not gatsby i said shortly
he was silent for a moment
the pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet
well he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together
a breeze stirred the grey haze of daisys fur collar
at least they are more interesting than the people we know she said with an effort
you did not look so interested
well i was
tom laughed and turned to me
did you notice daisys face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower
daisy began to sing with the music in a husky rhythmic whisper bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again
when the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly following it in a way contralto voices have and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air
lots of people come who have not been invited she said suddenly
that girl had not been invited
they simply force their way in and hes too polite to object
id like to know who he is and what he does insisted tom
and i think ill make a point of finding out
i can tell you right now she answered
he owned some drugstores a lot of drugstores
he built them up himself
the dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive
good night nick said daisy
her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where three oclock in the morning a neat sad little waltz of that year was drifting out the open door
after all in the very casualness of gatsbys party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world
what was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside
what would happen now in the dim incalculable hours
perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at gatsby one moment of magical encounter would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion
i stayed late that night
gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and i lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up chilled and exalted from the black beach until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead
when he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face and his eyes were bright and tired
she did not like it he said immediately
of course she did
she did not like it he insisted
she did not have a good time
he was silent and i guessed at his unutterable depression
i feel far away from her he said
it is hard to make her understand
you mean about the dance
the dance
he dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers
old sport the dance is unimportant
he wanted nothing less of daisy than that she should go to tom and say i never loved you
after she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken
one of them was that after she was free they were to go back to louisville and be married from her house just as if it were five years ago
and she does not understand he said
she used to be able to understand
wed sit for hours he broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers
i would not ask too much of her i ventured
you ca not repeat the past
ca not repeat the past
he cried incredulously
why of course you can
he looked around him wildly as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house just out of reach of his hand
i am going to fix everything just the way it was before he said nodding determinedly
shell see
he talked a lot about the past and i gathered that he wanted to recover something some idea of himself perhaps that had gone into loving daisy
one autumn night five years before they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight
they stopped here and turned toward each other
now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year
the quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars
out of the corner of his eye gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees he could climb to it if he climbed alone and once there he could suck on the pap of life gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder
his heart beat faster as daisys white face came up to his own
he knew that when he kissed this girl and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath his mind would never romp again like the mind of god
so he waited listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star
then he kissed her
at his lips touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete
through all he said even through his appalling sentimentality i was reminded of something an elusive rhythm a fragment of lost words that i had heard somewhere a long time ago
for a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb mans as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air
but they made no sound and what i had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever
vii it was when curiosity about gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one saturday night and as obscurely as it had begun his career as trimalchio was over
only gradually did i become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away
wondering if he were sick i went over to find out an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door
is mr
gatsby sick
nope
after a pause he added sir in a dilatory grudging way
i had not seen him around and i was rather worried
tell him mr
carraway came over
who
he demanded rudely
carraway
carraway
all right ill tell him
abruptly he slammed the door
my finn informed me that gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others who never went into west egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone
the grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty and the general opinion in the village was that the new people were not servants at all
next day gatsby called me on the phone
going away
i inquired
no old sport
i hear you fired all your servants
i wanted somebody who would not gossip
daisy comes over quite often in the afternoons
so the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes
theyre some people wolfshiem wanted to do something for
theyre all brothers and sisters
they used to run a small hotel
i see
he was calling up at daisys request would i come to lunch at her house tomorrow
miss baker would be there
half an hour later daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that i was coming
something was up
and yet i could not believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene especially for the rather harrowing scene that gatsby had outlined in the garden
the next day was broiling almost the last certainly the warmest of the summer
as my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight only the hot whistles of the national biscuit company broke the simmering hush at noon
the straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist and then as her newspaper dampened under her fingers lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry
her pocketbook slapped to the floor
oh my
she gasped
i picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her holding it at arms length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that i had no designs upon it but everyone near by including the woman suspected me just the same
hot
said the conductor to familiar faces
some weather
hot
hot
hot
is it hot enough for you
is it hot

my commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand
that anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart
through the hall of the buchanans house blew a faint wind carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to gatsby and me as we waited at the door
the masters body
roared the butler into the mouthpiece
i am sorry madame but we ca not furnish it it is far too hot to touch this noon
ill see
he set down the receiver and came toward us glistening slightly to take our stiff straw hats
madame expects you in the salon
he cried needlessly indicating the direction
in this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life
the room shadowed well with awnings was dark and cool
daisy and jordan lay upon an enormous couch like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans
we ca not move they said together
jordans fingers powdered white over their tan rested for a moment in mine
and mr
thomas buchanan the athlete
i inquired
simultaneously i heard his voice gruff muffled husky at the hall telephone
gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes
daisy watched him and laughed her sweet exciting laugh a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air
the rumour is whispered jordan that that is toms girl on the telephone
we were silent
and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time i wo not stand that at all
holding down the receiver said daisy cynically
no hes not i assured her
it is a bona fide deal
i happen to know about it
tom flung open the door blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body and hurried into the room
mr
gatsby
he put out his broad flat hand with well concealed dislike
make us a cold drink cried daisy
as he left the room again she got up and went over to gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the mouth
you know i love you she murmured
you forget theres a lady present said jordan
daisy looked around doubtfully
you kiss nick too
what a low vulgar girl
i do not care
cried daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace
then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room
bles sed pre cious she crooned holding out her arms
come to your own mother that loves you
the child relinquished by the nurse rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mothers dress
the bles sed pre cious
did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair
stand up now and say how de do
gatsby and i in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand
afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise
i do not think he had ever really believed in its existence before
i got dressed before luncheon said the child turning eagerly to daisy
that is because your mother wanted to show you off
her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck
you dream you
you absolute little dream
yes admitted the child calmly
aunt jordans got on a white dress too
how do you like mothers friends
daisy turned her around so that she faced gatsby
do you think theyre pretty
wheres daddy
she does not look like her father explained daisy
she looks like me
shes got my hair and shape of the face
daisy sat back upon the couch
the nurse took a step forward and held out her hand
come pammy
goodbye sweetheart
with a reluctant backward glance the well disciplined child held to her nurses hand and was pulled out the door just as tom came back preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice
gatsby took up his drink
they certainly look cool he said with visible tension
we drank in long greedy swallows
i read somewhere that the suns getting hotter every year said tom genially
it seems that pretty soon the earths going to fall into the sun or wait a minute it is just the opposite the suns getting colder every year
come outside he suggested to gatsby id like you to have a look at the place
i went with them out to the veranda
on the green sound stagnant in the heat one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea
gatsbys eyes followed it momentarily he raised his hand and pointed across the bay
i am right across from you
so you are
our eyes lifted over the rose beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog days alongshore
slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky
ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles
theres sport for you said tom nodding
id like to be out there with him for about an hour
we had luncheon in the dining room darkened too against the heat and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale
whatll we do with ourselves this afternoon
cried daisy and the day after that and the next thirty years
do not be morbid jordan said
life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall
but it is so hot insisted daisy on the verge of tears and everythings so confused
lets all go to town
her voice struggled on through the heat beating against it moulding its senselessness into forms
i have heard of making a garage out of a stable tom was saying to gatsby but i am the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage
who wants to go to town
demanded daisy insistently
gatsbys eyes floated toward her
ah she cried you look so cool
their eyes met and they stared together at each other alone in space
with an effort she glanced down at the table
you always look so cool she repeated
she had told him that she loved him and tom buchanan saw
he was astounded
his mouth opened a little and he looked at gatsby and then back at daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago
you resemble the advertisement of the man she went on innocently
you know the advertisement of the man all right broke in tom quickly i am perfectly willing to go to town
come on we are all going to town
he got up his eyes still flashing between gatsby and his wife
no one moved
come on
his temper cracked a little
what is the matter anyhow
if we are going to town lets start
his hand trembling with his effort at self control bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale
daisys voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive
are we just going to go
she objected
like this
are not we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first
everybody smoked all through lunch
oh lets have fun she begged him
it is too hot to fuss
he did not answer
have it your own way she said
come on jordan
they went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet
a silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky
gatsby started to speak changed his mind but not before tom wheeled and faced him expectantly
have you got your stables here
asked gatsby with an effort
about a quarter of a mile down the road
oh
a pause
i do not see the idea of going to town broke out tom savagely
women get these notions in their heads shall we take anything to drink
called daisy from an upper window
ill get some whisky answered tom
he went inside
gatsby turned to me rigidly i ca not say anything in his house old sport
shes got an indiscreet voice i remarked
it is full of i hesitated
her voice is full of money he said suddenly
that was it
id never understood before
tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel followed by daisy and jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms
shall we all go in my car
suggested gatsby
he felt the hot green leather of the seat
i ought to have left it in the shade
is it standard shift
demanded tom
yes
and let me drive your car to town
the suggestion was distasteful to gatsby
i do not think theres much gas he objected
plenty of gas said tom boisterously
he looked at the gauge
and if it runs out i can stop at a drugstore
you can buy anything at a drugstore nowadays
a pause followed this apparently pointless remark
daisy looked at tom frowning and an indefinable expression at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable as if i had only heard it described in words passed over gatsbys face
come on daisy said tom pressing her with his hand toward gatsbys car
ill take you in this circus wagon
he opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm
you take nick and jordan
she walked close to gatsby touching his coat with her hand
jordan and tom and i got into the front seat of gatsbys car tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind
did you see that
demanded tom
see what
he looked at me keenly realizing that jordan and i must have known all along
you think i am pretty dumb do not you
he suggested
perhaps i am but i have a almost a second sight sometimes that tells me what to do
maybe you do not believe that but science he paused
the immediate contingency overtook him pulled him back from the edge of theoretical abyss
i have made a small investigation of this fellow he continued
i could have gone deeper if id known do you mean you have been to a medium
inquired jordan humorously
what
confused he stared at us as we laughed
a medium
about gatsby
about gatsby
no i have not
i said id been making a small investigation of his past
and you found he was an oxford man said jordan helpfully
an oxford man
he was incredulous
like hell he is
he wears a pink suit
nevertheless hes an oxford man
oxford new mexico snorted tom contemptuously or something like that
listen tom
if you are such a snob why did you invite him to lunch
demanded jordan crossly
daisy invited him she knew him before we were married god knows where
we were all irritable now with the fading ale and aware of it we drove for a while in silence
then as doctor t
j
eckleburgs faded eyes came into sight down the road i remembered gatsbys caution about gasoline
we have got enough to get us to town said tom
but theres a garage right here objected jordan
i do not want to get stalled in this baking heat
tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under wilsons sign
after a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow eyed at the car
lets have some gas
cried tom roughly
what do you think we stopped for to admire the view
i am sick said wilson without moving
been sick all day
what is the matter
i am all run down
well shall i help myself
tom demanded
you sounded well enough on the phone
with an effort wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and breathing hard unscrewed the cap of the tank
in the sunlight his face was green
i did not mean to interrupt your lunch he said
but i need money pretty bad and i was wondering what you were going to do with your old car
how do you like this one
inquired tom
i bought it last week
it is a nice yellow one said wilson as he strained at the handle
like to buy it
big chance wilson smiled faintly
no but i could make some money on the other
what do you want money for all of a sudden
i have been here too long
i want to get away
my wife and i want to go west
your wife does exclaimed tom startled
shes been talking about it for ten years
he rested for a moment against the pump shading his eyes
and now shes going whether she wants to or not
i am going to get her away
flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand
what do i owe you
demanded tom harshly
i just got wised up to something funny the last two days remarked wilson
that is why i want to get away
that is why i been bothering you about the car
what do i owe you
dollar twenty
the relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and i had a bad moment there before i realized that so far his suspicions had not alighted on tom
he had discovered that myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick
i stared at him and then at tom who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men in intelligence or race so profound as the difference between the sick and the well
wilson was so sick that he looked guilty unforgivably guilty as if he had just got some poor girl with child
ill let you have that car said tom
ill send it over tomorrow afternoon
that locality was always vaguely disquieting even in the broad glare of afternoon and now i turned my head as though i had been warned of something behind
over the ash heaps the giant eyes of doctor t
j
eckleburg kept their vigil but i perceived after a moment that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away
in one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and myrtle wilson was peering down at the car
so engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture
her expression was curiously familiar it was an expression i had often seen on womens faces but on myrtle wilsons face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until i realized that her eyes wide with jealous terror were fixed not on tom but on jordan baker whom she took to be his wife
there is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind and as we drove away tom was feeling the hot whips of panic
his wife and his mistress until an hour ago secure and inviolate were slipping precipitately from his control
those big movies around fiftieth street are cool suggested jordan
i love new york on summer afternoons when everyones away
theres something very sensuous about it overripe as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands
came to a stop and daisy signalled us to draw up alongside
where are we going
she cried
how about the movies
it is so hot she complained
you go
well ride around and meet you after
with an effort her wit rose faintly
well meet you on some corner
ill be the man smoking two cigarettes
we ca not argue about it here tom said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us
you follow me to the south side of central park in front of the plaza
several times he turned his head and looked back for their car and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight
i think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever
but they did not
and we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the plaza hotel
the prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me though i have a sharp physical memory that in the course of it my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back
the notion originated with daisys suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths and then assumed more tangible form as a place to have a mint julep
the room was large and stifling and though it was already four oclock opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the park
daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us fixing her hair
it is a swell suite whispered jordan respectfully and everyone laughed
open another window commanded daisy without turning around
there are not any more
well wed better telephone for an axe the thing to do is to forget about the heat said tom impatiently
you make it ten times worse by crabbing about it
he unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table
why not let her alone old sport
remarked gatsby
you are the one that wanted to come to town
there was a moment of silence
the telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor whereupon jordan whispered excuse me but this time no one laughed
ill pick it up i offered
i have got it
gatsby examined the parted string muttered hum
in an interested way and tossed the book on a chair
that is a great expression of yours is not it
said tom sharply
what is
old sport business
whered you pick that up
now see here tom said daisy turning around from the mirror if you are going to make personal remarks i wo not stay here a minute
call up and order some ice for the mint julep
as tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of mendelssohns wedding march from the ballroom below
imagine marrying anybody in this heat
cried jordan dismally
still i was married in the middle of june daisy remembered
louisville in june
somebody fainted
who was it fainted tom
biloxi he answered shortly
a man named biloxi
blocks biloxi and he made boxes that is a fact and he was from biloxi tennessee
they carried him into my house appended jordan because we lived just two doors from the church
and he stayed three weeks until daddy told him he had to get out
the day after he left daddy died
after a moment she added
there was not any connection
i used to know a bill biloxi from memphis i remarked
that was his cousin
i knew his whole family history before he left
he gave me an aluminium putter that i use today
the music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window followed by intermittent cries of yea ea ea
and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began
we are getting old said daisy
if we were young wed rise and dance
remember biloxi jordan warned her
whered you know him tom
biloxi
he concentrated with an effort
i did not know him
he was a friend of daisys
he was not she denied
id never seen him before
he came down in the private car
well he said he knew you
he said he was raised in louisville
asa bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him
jordan smiled
he was probably bumming his way home
he told me he was president of your class at yale
tom and i looked at each other blankly
biloxi
first place we did not have any president gatsbys foot beat a short restless tattoo and tom eyed him suddenly
by the way mr
gatsby i understand you are an oxford man
not exactly
oh yes i understand you went to oxford
yes i went there
a pause
then toms voice incredulous and insulting you must have gone there about the time biloxi went to new haven
another pause
a waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his thank you and the soft closing of the door
this tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last
i told you i went there said gatsby
i heard you but id like to know when
it was in nineteen nineteen i only stayed five months
that is why i ca not really call myself an oxford man
tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief
but we were all looking at gatsby
it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice he continued
we could go to any of the universities in england or france
i wanted to get up and slap him on the back
i had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that id experienced before
daisy rose smiling faintly and went to the table
open the whisky tom she ordered and ill make you a mint julep
look at the mint
wait a minute snapped tom i want to ask mr
gatsby one more question
go on gatsby said politely
what kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow
they were out in the open at last and gatsby was content
he is not causing a row daisy looked desperately from one to the other
you are causing a row
please have a little self control
self control
repeated tom incredulously
i suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let mr
nobody from nowhere make love to your wife
nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next theyll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white
flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization
we are all white here murmured jordan
i know i am not very popular
i do not give big parties
i suppose you have got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends in the modern world
angry as i was as we all were i was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth
the transition from libertine to prig was so complete
i have got something to tell you old sport began gatsby
but daisy guessed at his intention
please do not
she interrupted helplessly
please lets all go home
why do not we all go home
that is a good idea i got up
come on tom
nobody wants a drink
i want to know what mr
gatsby has to tell me
your wife does not love you said gatsby
shes never loved you
she loves me
you must be crazy
exclaimed tom automatically
gatsby sprang to his feet vivid with excitement
she never loved you do you hear
he cried
she only married you because i was poor and she was tired of waiting for me
it was a terrible mistake but in her heart she never loved anyone except me
at this point jordan and i tried to go but tom and gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions
sit down daisy toms voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note
what is been going on
i want to hear all about it
i told you what is been going on said gatsby
going on for five years and you did not know
tom turned to daisy sharply
you have been seeing this fellow for five years
not seeing said gatsby
no we could not meet
but both of us loved each other all that time old sport and you did not know
i used to laugh sometimes but there was no laughter in his eyes to think that you did not know
oh that is all
tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair
you are crazy
he exploded
i ca not speak about what happened five years ago because i did not know daisy then and ill be damned if i see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door
but all the rest of that is a god damned lie
daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now
no said gatsby shaking his head
she does though
the trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and does not know what shes doing
he nodded sagely
and what is more i love daisy too
once in a while i go off on a spree and make a fool of myself but i always come back and in my heart i love her all the time
you are revolting said daisy
she turned to me and her voice dropping an octave lower filled the room with thrilling scorn do you know why we left chicago
i am surprised that they did not treat you to the story of that little spree
gatsby walked over and stood beside her
daisy that is all over now he said earnestly
it does not matter any more
just tell him the truth that you never loved him and it is all wiped out forever
she looked at him blindly
why how could i love him possibly
you never loved him
she hesitated
her eyes fell on jordan and me with a sort of appeal as though she realized at last what she was doing and as though she had never all along intended doing anything at all
but it was done now
it was too late
i never loved him she said with perceptible reluctance
not at kapiolani
demanded tom suddenly
no
from the ballroom beneath muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air
not that day i carried you down from the punch bowl to keep your shoes dry
daisy
please do not
her voice was cold but the rancour was gone from it
she looked at gatsby
there jay she said but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling
suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet
oh you want too much
she cried to gatsby
i love you now is not that enough
i ca not help what is past
she began to sob helplessly
i did love him once but i loved you too
gatsbys eyes opened and closed
you loved me too
he repeated
even that is a lie said tom savagely
she did not know you were alive
why theres things between daisy and me that youll never know things that neither of us can ever forget
the words seemed to bite physically into gatsby
i want to speak to daisy alone he insisted
shes all excited now even alone i ca not say i never loved tom she admitted in a pitiful voice
it would not be true
of course it would not agreed tom
she turned to her husband
as if it mattered to you she said
of course it matters
i am going to take better care of you from now on
you do not understand said gatsby with a touch of panic
you are not going to take care of her any more
i am not
tom opened his eyes wide and laughed
he could afford to control himself now
whys that
daisys leaving you
nonsense
i am though she said with a visible effort
shes not leaving me
toms words suddenly leaned down over gatsby
certainly not for a common swindler whod have to steal the ring he put on her finger
i wo not stand this
cried daisy
oh please lets get out
who are you anyhow
broke out tom
you are one of that bunch that hangs around with meyer wolfshiem that much i happen to know
i have made a little investigation into your affairs and ill carry it further tomorrow
you can suit yourself about that old sport said gatsby steadily
drugstores were
he turned to us and spoke rapidly
he and this wolfshiem bought up a lot of side street drugstores here and in chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter
that is one of his little stunts
i picked him for a bootlegger the first time i saw him and i was not far wrong
what about it
said gatsby politely
i guess your friend walter chase was not too proud to come in on it
and you left him in the lurch did not you
you let him go to jail for a month over in new jersey
god
you ought to hear walter on the subject of you
he came to us dead broke
he was very glad to pick up some money old sport
old sport
cried tom
gatsby said nothing
walter could have you up on the betting laws too but wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth
that unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in gatsbys face
that drugstore business was just small change continued tom slowly but you have got something on now that walters afraid to tell me about
i glanced at daisy who was staring terrified between gatsby and her husband and at jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin
then i turned back to gatsby and was startled at his expression
he looked and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden as if he had killed a man
for a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way
it passed and he began to talk excitedly to daisy denying everything defending his name against accusations that had not been made
but with every word she was drawing further and further into herself so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away trying to touch what was no longer tangible struggling unhappily undespairingly toward that lost voice across the room
the voice begged again to go
please tom
i ca not stand this any more
her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions whatever courage she had had were definitely gone
you two start on home daisy said tom
in mr
gatsbys car
she looked at tom alarmed now but he insisted with magnanimous scorn
go on
he wo not annoy you
i think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over
they were gone without a word snapped out made accidental isolated like ghosts even from our pity
after a moment tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whisky in the towel
want any of this stuff
jordan
nick
i did not answer
nick
he asked again
what
want any
i just remembered that todays my birthday
i was thirty
before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade
with him and started for long island
tom talked incessantly exulting and laughing but his voice was as remote from jordan and me as the foreign clamour on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead
human sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind
thirty the promise of a decade of loneliness a thinning list of single men to know a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm thinning hair
but there was jordan beside me who unlike daisy was too wise ever to carry well forgotten dreams from age to age
as we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coats shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand
so we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight
the young greek michaelis who ran the coffee joint beside the ash heaps was the principal witness at the inquest
he had slept through the heat until after five when he strolled over to the garage and found george wilson sick in his office really sick pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over
michaelis advised him to go to bed but wilson refused saying that hed miss a lot of business if he did
while his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead
i have got my wife locked in up there explained wilson calmly
shes going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we are going to move away
michaelis was astonished they had been neighbours for four years and wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement
generally he was one of these worn out men when he was not working he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road
when anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable colourless way
he was his wifes man and not his own
so naturally michaelis tried to find out what had happened but wilson would not say a word instead he began to throw curious suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what hed been doing at certain times on certain days
just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and michaelis took the opportunity to get away intending to come back later
but he did not
he supposed he forgot to that is all
when he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard mrs
wilsons voice loud and scolding downstairs in the garage
beat me
he heard her cry
throw me down and beat me you dirty little coward
a moment later she rushed out into the dusk waving her hands and shouting before he could move from his door the business was over
the death car as the newspapers called it did not stop it came out of the gathering darkness wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend
mavro michaelis was not even sure of its colour he told the first policeman that it was light green
the other car the one going toward new york came to rest a hundred yards beyond and its driver hurried back to where myrtle wilson her life violently extinguished knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust
michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath
the mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long
we saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away
wreck
said tom
that is good
wilsonll have a little business at last
he slowed down but still without any intention of stopping until as we came nearer the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes
well take a look he said doubtfully just a look
and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words oh my god
uttered over and over in a gasping moan
theres some bad trouble here said tom excitedly
he reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead
then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through
the circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation it was a minute before i could see anything at all
then new arrivals deranged the line and jordan and i were pushed suddenly inside
myrtle wilsons body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a worktable by the wall and tom with his back to us was bending over it motionless
next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book
at first i could not find the source of the high groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage then i saw wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands
some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder but wilson neither heard nor saw
his eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call oh my ga od
oh my ga od
oh ga od
oh my ga od
presently tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman
m a v the policeman was saying o no r corrected the man m a v r o listen to me
muttered tom fiercely
r said the policeman o g g he looked up as toms broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder
what you want fella
what happened
that is what i want to know
auto hit her
insantly killed
instantly killed repeated tom staring
she ran out ina road
son of a bitch did not even stopus car
there was two cars said michaelis one comin one goin see
going where
asked the policeman keenly
one goin each way
well she his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his side she ran out there an the one comin from nyork knock right into her goin thirty or forty miles an hour
what is the name of this place here
demanded the officer
has not got any name
a pale well dressed negro stepped near
it was a yellow car he said big yellow car
new
see the accident
asked the policeman
no but the car passed me down the road going fastern forty
going fifty sixty
come here and lets have your name
look out now
i want to get his name
some words of this conversation must have reached wilson swaying in the office door for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries you do not have to tell me what kind of car it was
i know what kind of car it was
watching tom i saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat
he walked quickly over to wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms
you have got to pull yourself together he said with soothing gruffness
wilsons eyes fell upon tom he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not tom held him upright
listen said tom shaking him a little
i just got here a minute ago from new york
we have been talking about
that yellow car i was driving this afternoon was not mine do you hear
i have not seen it all afternoon
only the negro and i were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes
what is all that
he demanded
i am a friend of his
tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on wilsons body
it was a yellow car
some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at tom
and what colours your car
we have come straight from new york i said
someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away
now if youll let me have that name again correct picking up wilson like a doll tom carried him into the office set him down in a chair and came back
if somebodyll come here and sit with him he snapped authoritatively
he watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room
then tom shut the door on them and came down the single step his eyes avoiding the table
as he passed close to me he whispered lets get out
self consciously with his authoritative arms breaking the way we pushed through the still gathering crowd passing a hurried doctor case in hand who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago
raced along through the night
in a little while i heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face
the god damned coward
he whimpered
he did not even stop his car
the buchanans house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees
tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two windows bloomed with light among the vines
daisys home he said
as we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly
i ought to have dropped you in west egg nick
theres nothing we can do tonight
a change had come over him and he spoke gravely and with decision
as we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases
ill telephone for a taxi to take you home and while you are waiting you and jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper if you want any
he opened the door
come in
no thanks
but id be glad if you would order me the taxi
ill wait outside
jordan put her hand on my arm
wo not you come in nick
no thanks
i was feeling a little sick and i wanted to be alone
but jordan lingered for a moment more
it is only half past nine she said
id be damned if id go in id had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included jordan too
she must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house
i sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands until i heard the phone taken up inside and the butlers voice calling a taxi
then i walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate
i had not gone twenty yards when i heard my name and gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path
i must have felt pretty weird by that time because i could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon
what are you doing
i inquired
just standing here old sport
somehow that seemed a despicable occupation
for all i knew he was going to rob the house in a moment i would not have been surprised to see sinister faces the faces of wolfshiems people behind him in the dark shrubbery
did you see any trouble on the road
he asked after a minute
yes
he hesitated
was she killed
yes
i thought so i told daisy i thought so
it is better that the shock should all come at once
she stood it pretty well
he spoke as if daisys reaction was the only thing that mattered
i got to west egg by a side road he went on and left the car in my garage
i do not think anybody saw us but of course i ca not be sure
i disliked him so much by this time that i did not find it necessary to tell him he was wrong
who was the woman
he inquired
her name was wilson
her husband owns the garage
how the devil did it happen
well i tried to swing the wheel he broke off and suddenly i guessed at the truth
was daisy driving
yes he said after a moment but of course ill say i was
you see when we left new york she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way
it all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us thought we were somebody she knew
well first daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car and then she lost her nerve and turned back
the second my hand reached the wheel i felt the shock it must have killed her instantly
it ripped her open do not tell me old sport
he winced
anyhow daisy stepped on it
i tried to make her stop but she could not so i pulled on the emergency brake
then she fell over into my lap and i drove on
shell be all right tomorrow he said presently
i am just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon
shes locked herself into her room and if he tries any brutality shes going to turn the light out and on again
he wo not touch her i said
hes not thinking about her
i do not trust him old sport
how long are you going to wait
all night if necessary
anyhow till they all go to bed
a new point of view occurred to me
suppose tom found out that daisy had been driving
he might think he saw a connection in it he might think anything
i looked at the house there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from daisys room on the ground floor
you wait here i said
ill see if theres any sign of a commotion
i walked back along the border of the lawn traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps
the drawing room curtains were open and i saw that the room was empty
crossing the porch where we had dined that june night three months before i came to a small rectangle of light which i guessed was the pantry window
the blind was drawn but i found a rift at the sill
daisy and tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale
he was talking intently across the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own
once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement
they were not happy and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale and yet they were not unhappy either
there was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together
as i tiptoed from the porch i heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house
gatsby was waiting where i had left him in the drive
is it all quiet up there
he asked anxiously
yes it is all quiet
i hesitated
you would better come home and get some sleep
he shook his head
i want to wait here till daisy goes to bed
good night old sport
he put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil
so i walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight watching over nothing
viii i could not sleep all night a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the sound and i tossed half sick between grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams
toward dawn i heard a taxi go up gatsbys drive and immediately i jumped out of bed and began to dress i felt that i had something to tell him something to warn him about and morning would be too late
crossing his lawn i saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall heavy with dejection or sleep
nothing happened he said wanly
i waited and about four oclock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light
his house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes
we pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches once i tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano
there was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they had not been aired for many days
i found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside
throwing open the french windows of the drawing room we sat smoking out into the darkness
you ought to go away i said
it is pretty certain theyll trace your car
go away now old sport
go to atlantic city for a week or up to montreal
he would not consider it
he could not possibly leave daisy until he knew what she was going to do
he was clutching at some last hope and i could not bear to shake him free
it was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with dan cody told it to me because jay gatsby had broken up like glass against toms hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out
i think that he would have acknowledged anything now without reserve but he wanted to talk about daisy
she was the first nice girl he had ever known
in various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between
he found her excitingly desirable
he went to her house at first with other officers from camp taylor then alone
it amazed him he had never been in such a beautiful house before
but what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that daisy lived there it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him
there was a ripe mystery about it a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this years shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered
it excited him too that many men had already loved daisy it increased her value in his eyes
he felt their presence all about the house pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions
but he knew that he was in daisys house by a colossal accident
however glorious might be his future as jay gatsby he was at present a penniless young man without a past and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders
so he made the most of his time
he took what he could get ravenously and unscrupulously eventually he took daisy one still october night took her because he had no real right to touch her hand
he might have despised himself for he had certainly taken her under false pretences
i do not mean that he had traded on his phantom millions but he had deliberately given daisy a sense of security he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself that he was fully able to take care of her
as a matter of fact he had no such facilities he had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world
but he did not despise himself and it did not turn out as he had imagined
he had intended probably to take what he could and go but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail
he knew that daisy was extraordinary but he did not realize just how extraordinary a nice girl could be
she vanished into her rich house into her rich full life leaving gatsby nothing
he felt married to her that was all
when they met again two days later it was gatsby who was breathless who was somehow betrayed
her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star shine the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth
she had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves of the freshness of many clothes and of daisy gleaming like silver safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor
i ca not describe to you how surprised i was to find out i loved her old sport
i even hoped for a while that shed throw me over but she did not because she was in love with me too
well there i was way off my ambitions getting deeper in love every minute and all of a sudden i did not care
what was the use of doing great things if i could have a better time telling her what i was going to do
on the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with daisy in his arms for a long silent time
it was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed
now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair
the afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised
they had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coats shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers gently as though she were asleep
he did extraordinarily well in the war
he was a captain before he went to the front and following the argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine guns
after the armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to oxford instead
he was worried now there was a quality of nervous despair in daisys letters
she did not see why he could not come
she was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all
for daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes
all night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the beale street blues while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust
at the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor
through this twilight universe daisy began to move again with the season suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed
and all the time something within her was crying for a decision
she wanted her life shaped now immediately and the decision must be made by some force of love of money of unquestionable practicality that was close at hand
that force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of tom buchanan
there was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position and daisy was flattered
doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief
the letter reached gatsby while he was still at oxford
it was dawn now on long island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs filling the house with grey turning gold turning light
the shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves
there was a slow pleasant movement in the air scarcely a wind promising a cool lovely day
i do not think she ever loved him
gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly
you must remember old sport she was very excited this afternoon
he told her those things in a way that frightened her that made it look as if i was some kind of cheap sharper
and the result was she hardly knew what she was saying
he sat down gloomily
of course she might have loved him just for a minute when they were first married and loved me more even then do you see
suddenly he came out with a curious remark
in any case he said it was just personal
what could you make of that except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that could not be measured
he came back from france when tom and daisy were still on their wedding trip and made a miserable but irresistible journey to louisville on the last of his army pay
he stayed there a week walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the november night and revisiting the out of the way places to which they had driven in her white car
just as daisys house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his idea of the city itself even though she was gone from it was pervaded with a melancholy beauty
he left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found her that he was leaving her behind
the day coach he was penniless now was hot
he went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding chair and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by
then out into the spring fields where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street
the track curved and now it was going away from the sun which as it sank lower seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath
he stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him
but it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it the freshest and the best forever
it was nine oclock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch
the night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air
the gardener the last one of gatsbys former servants came to the foot of the steps
i am going to drain the pool today mr
gatsby
leavesll start falling pretty soon and then theres always trouble with the pipes
do not do it today gatsby answered
he turned to me apologetically
you know old sport i have never used that pool all summer
i looked at my watch and stood up
twelve minutes to my train
i did not want to go to the city
i was not worth a decent stroke of work but it was more than that i did not want to leave gatsby
i missed that train and then another before i could get myself away
ill call you up i said finally
do old sport
ill call you about noon
we walked slowly down the steps
i suppose daisyll call too
he looked at me anxiously as if he hoped id corroborate this
i suppose so
well goodbye
we shook hands and i started away
just before i reached the hedge i remembered something and turned around
theyre a rotten crowd i shouted across the lawn
you are worth the whole damn bunch put together
i have always been glad i said that
it was the only compliment i ever gave him because i disapproved of him from beginning to end
first he nodded politely and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile as if wed been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time
his gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps and i thought of the night when i first came to his ancestral home three months before
the lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption and he had stood on those steps concealing his incorruptible dream as he waved them goodbye
i thanked him for his hospitality
we were always thanking him for that i and the others
goodbye i called
i enjoyed breakfast gatsby
up in the city i tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock then i fell asleep in my swivel chair
just before noon the phone woke me and i started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead
it was jordan baker she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way
usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry
i have left daisys house she said
i am at hempstead and i am going down to southampton this afternoon
probably it had been tactful to leave daisys house but the act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid
you were not so nice to me last night
how could it have mattered then
silence for a moment
then however i want to see you
i want to see you too
suppose i do not go to southampton and come into town this afternoon
no i do not think this afternoon
very well
it is impossible this afternoon
various we talked like that for a while and then abruptly we were not talking any longer
i do not know which of us hung up with a sharp click but i know i did not care
i could not have talked to her across a tea table that day if i never talked to her again in this world
i called gatsbys house a few minutes later but the line was busy
i tried four times finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from detroit
taking out my timetable i drew a small circle around the three fifty train
then i leaned back in my chair and tried to think
it was just noon
when i passed the ash heaps on the train that morning i had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car
i supposed thered be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer and myrtle wilsons tragic achievement was forgotten
now i want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before
they had difficulty in locating the sister catherine
she must have broken her rule against drinking that night for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to flushing
when they convinced her of this she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of the affair
someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sisters body
until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage while george wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside
for a while the door of the office was open and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it
finally someone said it was a shame and closed the door
michaelis and several other men were with him first four or five men later two or three men
still later michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee
after that he stayed there alone with wilson until dawn
about three oclock the quality of wilsons incoherent muttering changed he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car
he announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen
but when he heard himself say this he flinched and began to cry oh my god
again in his groaning voice
michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him
how long have you been married george
come on there try and sit still a minute and answer my question
how long have you been married
twelve years
ever had any children
come on george sit still i asked you a question
did you ever have any children
the hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that had not stopped a few hours before
he did not like to go into the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office he knew every object in it before morning and from time to time sat down beside wilson trying to keep him more quiet
have you got a church you go to sometimes george
maybe even if you have not been there for a long time
maybe i could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you see
do not belong to any
you ought to have a church george for times like this
you must have gone to church once
did not you get married in a church
listen george listen to me
did not you get married in a church
that was a long time ago
the effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking for a moment he was silent
then the same half knowing half bewildered look came back into his faded eyes
look in the drawer there he said pointing at the desk
which drawer
that drawer that one
michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand
there was nothing in it but a small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver
it was apparently new
this
he inquired holding it up
wilson stared and nodded
i found it yesterday afternoon
she tried to tell me about it but i knew it was something funny
you mean your wife bought it
she had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau
michaelis did not see anything odd in that and he gave wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash
but conceivably wilson had heard some of these same explanations before from myrtle because he began saying oh my god
again in a whisper his comforter left several explanations in the air
then he killed her said wilson
his mouth dropped open suddenly
who did
i have a way of finding out
you are morbid george said his friend
this has been a strain to you and you do not know what you are saying
you would better try and sit quiet till morning
he murdered her
it was an accident george
wilson shook his head
his eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior hm
i know he said definitely
i am one of these trusting fellas and i do not think any harm to nobody but when i get to know a thing i know it
it was the man in that car
she ran out to speak to him and he would not stop
michaelis had seen this too but it had not occurred to him that there was any special significance in it
he believed that mrs
wilson had been running away from her husband rather than trying to stop any particular car
how could she of been like that
shes a deep one said wilson as if that answered the question
ah h h he began to rock again and michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand
maybe you got some friend that i could telephone for george
this was a forlorn hope he was almost sure that wilson had no friend there was not enough of him for his wife
he was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room a blue quickening by the window and realized that dawn was not far off
about five oclock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light
wilsons glazed eyes turned out to the ash heaps where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind
i spoke to her he muttered after a long silence
i told her she might fool me but she could not fool god
god knows what you have been doing everything you have been doing
you may fool me but you ca not fool god
standing behind him michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of doctor t
j
eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night
god sees everything repeated wilson
that is an advertisement michaelis assured him
something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room
but wilson stood there a long time his face close to the window pane nodding into the twilight
by six oclock michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside
it was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man ate together
wilson was quieter now and michaelis went home to sleep when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage wilson was gone
his movements he was on foot all the time were afterward traced to port roosevelt and then to gads hill where he bought a sandwich that he did not eat and a cup of coffee
he must have been tired and walking slowly for he did not reach gads hill until noon
thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time there were boys who had seen a man acting sort of crazy and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road
then for three hours he disappeared from view
the police on the strength of what he said to michaelis that he had a way of finding out supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout inquiring for a yellow car
on the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward and perhaps he had an easier surer way of finding out what he wanted to know
by half past two he was in west egg where he asked someone the way to gatsbys house
so by that time he knew gatsbys name
at two oclock gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool
he stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up
then he gave instructions that the open car was not to be taken out under any circumstances and this was strange because the front right fender needed repair
gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool
once he stopped and shifted it a little and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees
no telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four oclock until long after there was anyone to give it to if it came
i have an idea that gatsby himself did not believe it would come and perhaps he no longer cared
if that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world paid a high price for living too long with a single dream
he must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass
like that ashen fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees
s heard the shots afterwards he could only say that he had not thought anything much about them
i drove from the station directly to gatsbys house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed anyone
but they knew then i firmly believe
with scarcely a word said four of us the chauffeur butler gardener and i hurried down to the pool
there was a faint barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other
with little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool
a small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden
the touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly tracing like the leg of transit a thin red circle in the water
it was after we started with gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw wilsons body a little way off in the grass and the holocaust was complete
ix after two years i remember the rest of that day and that night and the next day only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of gatsbys front door
a rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and there were always a few of them clustered open mouthed about the pool
someone with a positive manner perhaps a detective used the expression madman as he bent over wilsons body that afternoon and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning
most of those reports were a nightmare grotesque circumstantial eager and untrue
when michaeliss testimony at the inquest brought to light wilsons suspicions of his wife i thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade but catherine who might have said anything did not say a word
she showed a surprising amount of character about it too looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen gatsby that her sister was completely happy with her husband that her sister had been into no mischief whatever
she convinced herself of it and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure
so wilson was reduced to a man deranged by grief in order that the case might remain in its simplest form
and it rested there
but all this part of it seemed remote and unessential
i found myself on gatsbys side and alone
from the moment i telephoned news of the catastrophe to west egg village every surmise about him and every practical question was referred to me
at first i was surprised and confused then as he lay in his house and did not move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that i was responsible because no one else was interested interested i mean with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end
i called up daisy half an hour after we found him called her instinctively and without hesitation
but she and tom had gone away early that afternoon and taken baggage with them
left no address
no
say when theyd be back
no
any idea where they are
how i could reach them
i do not know
ca not say
i wanted to get somebody for him
i wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him ill get somebody for you gatsby
do not worry
just trust me and ill get somebody for you meyer wolfshiems name was not in the phone book
the butler gave me his office address on broadway and i called information but by the time i had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone
will you ring again
i have rung three times
it is very important
sorry
i am afraid no ones there
i went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors all these official people who suddenly filled it
but though they drew back the sheet and looked at gatsby with shocked eyes his protest continued in my brain look here old sport you have got to get somebody for me
you have got to try hard
i ca not go through this alone
someone started to ask me questions but i broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk hed never told me definitely that his parents were dead
but there was nothing only the picture of dan cody a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall
next morning i sent the butler to new york with a letter to wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train
that request seemed superfluous when i wrote it
i was sure hed start when he saw the newspapers just as i was sure thered be a wire from daisy before noon but neither a wire nor mr
wolfshiem arrived no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men
when the butler brought back wolfshiems answer i began to have a feeling of defiance of scornful solidarity between gatsby and me against them all
dear mr
carraway
this has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me i hardly can believe it that it is true at all
such a mad act as that man did should make us all think
i cannot come down now as i am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now
if there is anything i can do a little later let me know in a letter by edgar
i hardly know where i am when i hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out
yours truly meyer wolfshiem and then hasty addenda beneath let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all
when the phone rang that afternoon and long distance said chicago was calling i thought this would be daisy at last
but the connection came through as a mans voice very thin and far away
yes
the name was unfamiliar
hell of a note is not it
get my wire
there have not been any wires
young parkes in trouble he said rapidly
they picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter
they got a circular from new york giving em the numbers just five minutes before
what dyou know about that hey
you never can tell in these hick towns hello
i interrupted breathlessly
look here this is not mr
gatsby
mr
gatsbys dead
then a quick squawk as the connection was broken
i think it was on the third day that a telegram signed henry c
gatz arrived from a town in minnesota
it said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came
it was gatsbys father a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm september day
his eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when i took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that i had difficulty in getting off his coat
he was on the point of collapse so i took him into the music room and made him sit down while i sent for something to eat
but he would not eat and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand
i saw it in the chicago newspaper he said
it was all in the chicago newspaper
i started right away
i did not know how to reach you
his eyes seeing nothing moved ceaselessly about the room
it was a madman he said
he must have been mad
would not you like some coffee
i urged him
i do not want anything
i am all right now mr
carraway
well i am all right now
where have they got jimmy
i took him into the drawing room where his son lay and left him there
some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall when i told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away
after a little while mr
gatz opened the door and came out his mouth ajar his face flushed slightly his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears
he had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride
i helped him to a bedroom upstairs while he took off his coat and vest i told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came
i did not know what you would want mr
gatsby gatz is my name
mr
gatz
i thought you might want to take the body west
he shook his head
jimmy always liked it better down east
he rose up to his position in the east
were you a friend of my boys mr

we were close friends
he had a big future before him you know
he was only a young man but he had a lot of brain power here
he touched his head impressively and i nodded
if hed of lived hed of been a great man
a man like james j
hill
hed of helped build up the country
that is true i said uncomfortably
he fumbled at the embroidered coverlet trying to take it from the bed and lay down stiffly was instantly asleep
that night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know who i was before he would give his name
this is mr
carraway i said
oh
he sounded relieved
this is klipspringer
i was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend at gatsbys grave
i did not want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd so id been calling up a few people myself
they were hard to find
the funerals tomorrow i said
three oclock here at the house
i wish you would tell anybody whod be interested
oh i will he broke out hastily
of course i am not likely to see anybody but if i do
his tone made me suspicious
of course youll be there yourself
well ill certainly try
what i called up about is wait a minute i interrupted
how about saying youll come
well the fact is the truth of the matter is that i am staying with some people up here in greenwich and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow
in fact theres a sort of picnic or something
of course ill do my best to get away
i ejaculated an unrestrained huh
and he must have heard me for he went on nervously what i called up about was a pair of shoes i left there
i wonder if itd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on
you see theyre tennis shoes and i am sort of helpless without them
my address is care of b
f
i did not hear the rest of the name because i hung up the receiver
after that i felt a certain shame for gatsby one gentleman to whom i telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved
however that was my fault for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at gatsby on the courage of gatsbys liquor and i should have known better than to call him
the morning of the funeral i went up to new york to see meyer wolfshiem i could not seem to reach him any other way
the door that i pushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked the swastika holding company and at first there did not seem to be anyone inside
but when id shouted hello several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes
nobodys in she said
mr
wolfshiems gone to chicago
the first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to whistle the rosary tunelessly inside
please say that mr
carraway wants to see him
i ca not get him back from chicago can i
at this moment a voice unmistakably wolfshiems called stella
from the other side of the door
leave your name on the desk she said quickly
ill give it to him when he gets back
but i know hes there
she took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips
you young men think you can force your way in here any time she scolded
we are getting sickantired of it
when i say hes in chicago hes in chicago
i mentioned gatsby
oh h
she looked at me over again
will you just what was your name
she vanished
in a moment meyer wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway holding out both hands
he drew me into his office remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us and offered me a cigar
my memory goes back to when first i met him he said
a young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war
he was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he could not buy some regular clothes
first time i saw him was when he came into winebrenners poolroom at forty third street and asked for a job
he had not eat anything for a couple of days
come on have some lunch with me i said
he ate more than four dollars worth of food in half an hour
did you start him in business
i inquired
start him
i made him
oh
i raised him up out of nothing right out of the gutter
i saw right away he was a fine appearing gentlemanly young man and when he told me he was at oggsford i knew i could use him good
i got him to join the american legion and he used to stand high there
right off he did some work for a client of mine up to albany
we were so thick like that in everything he held up two bulbous fingers always together
i wondered if this partnership had included the worlds series transaction in 1919
now hes dead i said after a moment
you were his closest friend so i know youll want to come to his funeral this afternoon
id like to come
well come then
the hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears
i ca not do it i ca not get mixed up in it he said
theres nothing to get mixed up in
it is all over now
when a man gets killed i never like to get mixed up in it in any way
i keep out
when i was a young man it was different if a friend of mine died no matter how i stuck with them to the end
you may think that is sentimental but i mean it to the bitter end
i saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come so i stood up
are you a college man
he inquired suddenly
for a moment i thought he was going to suggest a gonnegtion but he only nodded and shook my hand
let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead he suggested
after that my own rule is to let everything alone
when i left his office the sky had turned dark and i got back to west egg in a drizzle
after changing my clothes i went next door and found mr
gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall
his pride in his son and in his sons possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me
jimmy sent me this picture
he took out his wallet with trembling fingers
look there
it was a photograph of the house cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands
he pointed out every detail to me eagerly
look there
and then sought admiration from my eyes
he had shown it so often that i think it was more real to him now than the house itself
jimmy sent it to me
i think it is a very pretty picture
it shows up well
very well
had you seen him lately
he come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house i live in now
of course we was broke up when he run off from home but i see now there was a reason for it
he knew he had a big future in front of him
and ever since he made a success he was very generous with me
he seemed reluctant to put away the picture held it for another minute lingeringly before my eyes
then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called hopalong cassidy
look here this is a book he had when he was a boy
it just shows you
he opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see
on the last flyleaf was printed the word schedule and the date september 12 1906
and underneath rise from bed 6 00 a
m
dumbell exercise and wall scaling 6 15 6 30 study electricity etc

be better to parents i came across this book by accident said the old man
it just shows you do not it
it just shows you
jimmy was bound to get ahead
he always had some resolves like this or something
do you notice what hes got about improving his mind
he was always great for that
he told me i et like a hog once and i beat him for it
he was reluctant to close the book reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me
i think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use
a little before three the lutheran minister arrived from flushing and i began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars
so did gatsbys father
and as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall his eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way
the minister glanced several times at his watch so i took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour
but it was not any use
nobody came
about five oclock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate first a motor hearse horribly black and wet then mr
gatz and the minister and me in the limousine and a little later four or five servants and the postman from west egg in gatsbys station wagon all wet to the skin
as we started through the gate into the cemetery i heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground
i looked around
it was the man with owl eyed glasses whom i had found marvelling over gatsbys books in the library one night three months before
id never seen him since then
i do not know how he knew about the funeral or even his name
the rain poured down his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from gatsbys grave
i tried to think about gatsby then for a moment but he was already too far away and i could only remember without resentment that daisy had not sent a message or a flower
dimly i heard someone murmur blessed are the dead that the rain falls on and then the owl eyed man said amen to that in a brave voice
we straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars
owl eyes spoke to me by the gate
i could not get to the house he remarked
neither could anybody else
go on
he started
why my god
they used to go there by the hundreds
he took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in
the poor son of a bitch he said
one of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school and later from college at christmas time
those who went farther than chicago would gather in the old dim union station at six oclock of a december evening with a few chicago friends already caught up into their own holiday gaieties to bid them a hasty goodbye
i remember the fur coats of the girls returning from miss this or that is and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations are you going to the ordways
the herseys
the schultzes
and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands
and last the murky yellow cars of the chicago milwaukee and st
paul railroad looking cheerful as christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate
when we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow our snow began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows and the dim lights of small wisconsin stations moved by a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air
we drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again
that is my middle west not the wheat or the prairies or the lost swede towns but the thrilling returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow
i am part of that a little solemn with the feel of those long winters a little complacent from growing up in the carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a familys name
i see now that this has been a story of the west after all tom and gatsby daisy and jordan and i were all westerners and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to eastern life
even when the east excited me most even when i was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored sprawling swollen towns beyond the ohio with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old even then it had always for me a quality of distortion
west egg especially still figures in my more fantastic dreams
i see it as a night scene by el greco a hundred houses at once conventional and grotesque crouching under a sullen overhanging sky and a lustreless moon
in the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress
her hand which dangles over the side sparkles cold with jewels
gravely the men turn in at a house the wrong house
but no one knows the womans name and no one cares
after gatsbys death the east was haunted for me like that distorted beyond my eyes power of correction
so when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line i decided to come back home
there was one thing to be done before i left an awkward unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone
but i wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away
i saw jordan baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened afterward to me and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair
she was dressed to play golf and i remember thinking she looked like a good illustration her chin raised a little jauntily her hair the colour of an autumn leaf her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee
when i had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man
i doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but i pretended to be surprised
for just a minute i wondered if i was not making a mistake then i thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye
nevertheless you did throw me over said jordan suddenly
you threw me over on the telephone
i do not give a damn about you now but it was a new experience for me and i felt a little dizzy for a while
we shook hands
oh and do you remember she added a conversation we had once about driving a car
why not exactly
you said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver
well i met another bad driver did not i
i mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess
i thought you were rather an honest straightforward person
i thought it was your secret pride
i am thirty i said
i am five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour
she did not answer
angry and half in love with her and tremendously sorry i turned away
one afternoon late in october i saw tom buchanan
he was walking ahead of me along fifth avenue in his alert aggressive way his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference his head moving sharply here and there adapting itself to his restless eyes
just as i slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store
suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out his hand
what is the matter nick
do you object to shaking hands with me
yes
you know what i think of you
you are crazy nick he said quickly
crazy as hell
i do not know what is the matter with you
tom i inquired what did you say to wilson that afternoon
he stared at me without a word and i knew i had guessed right about those missing hours
i started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm
i told him the truth he said
he came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when i sent down word that we were not in he tried to force his way upstairs
he was crazy enough to kill me if i had not told him who owned the car
his hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house he broke off defiantly
what if i did tell him
that fellow had it coming to him
he threw dust into your eyes just like he did in daisys but he was a tough one
he ran over myrtle like you would run over a dog and never even stopped his car
there was nothing i could say except the one unutterable fact that it was not true
and if you think i did not have my share of suffering look here when i went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard i sat down and cried like a baby
by god it was awful i could not forgive him or like him but i saw that what he had done was to him entirely justified
it was all very careless and confused
i shook hands with him it seemed silly not to for i felt suddenly as though i were talking to a child
then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklace or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons rid of my provincial squeamishness forever
gatsbys house was still empty when i left the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine
one of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside perhaps it was he who drove daisy and gatsby over to east egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own
i did not want to hear it and i avoided him when i got off the train
i spent my saturday nights in new york because those gleaming dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that i could still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down his drive
one night i did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his front steps
but i did not investigate
probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and did not know that the party was over
on the last night with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer i went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more
on the white steps an obscene word scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick stood out clearly in the moonlight and i erased it drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone
then i wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand
most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy moving glow of a ferryboat across the sound
and as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually i became aware of the old island here that flowered once for dutch sailors eyes a fresh green breast of the new world
its vanished trees the trees that had made way for gatsbys house had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder
and as i sat there brooding on the old unknown world i thought of gatsbys wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of daisys dock
he had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it
he did not know that it was already behind him somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night
gatsby believed in the green light the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us
and one fine morning so we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past
